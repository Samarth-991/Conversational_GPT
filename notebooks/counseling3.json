They know with which project you have taken with what property you have taken if the person who you got this deal done with can tell you whether the property has a payment plan or not. The mortgage is completely different which is once you paid the payment and you want it to be financed by the bank that is completely different the developer is not involved. Yeah, yeah.

                "text": "conversation with Customer Maryam Rasaei: Hello. Hello, good morning. Hi, good morning. Am I speaking to Ms. Mariam? Yes. Ms. Mariam, I am Juraro calling you from Pripko Services. How are you doing today? Thank you so much. How are you? I am good. Thank you so much for asking. I have got an inquiry that you are looking for ModGate from Mr. Gan Fernando. Yes, yes. Yeah, you are planning to purchase Vela, but you want ModGate on that, right? Yes. Yes, I am calling you on that. I want to know the condition and also how much is the maximum loan or ModGate that we can take and for giving back that, how much is the profit and how much time does it take? See, I will tell you one thing. You are a resident of Dubai, right? Yes. Yeah. So you will get up to 80%. So you have to arrange, say for example, if you are planning to buy a Vela, you have to do the down payment on your own, whether it's 24% or 20% from the developer, you have to do that on your own. So Bank will give you up to 80% ModGate. Okay. Now, if we compare rates from January to rates in May now, rates are going lesser, like lower, it's fluctuating. Yeah. So it's the best time to go for ModGate because rates are starting from 3.99 onwards earlier, it was before 0.9. Now it's 3.9. Yes. And if you talk about pre-approval, pre-approval you will get within five working days. And then once the pre-approval is with you, it will last for 45 days with you, the validity. Okay. So you have to avail and finalize the property within that period of time so that you can start your ModGate on your property. Okay. Otherwise, if you just cross the 45 days after having the pre-approval, then you have to start the process from zero again. Okay. Okay. And depending upon your age and your choice, for how many years you want to take this ModGate for. So on that basis, the total amount which you are taking and the rate which you are finding suitable for you will be applied on the total amount and will be divided by the months which are coming in those years. And then with that, whatever the amount will come from that side, that will be your monthly EMI for your ModGate on basis of your salary. Okay. You said based on the salary, but my husband is a business owner. That is okay. We just, for the business owner, we have to understand what is the turnover, how long is the business, and what is the minimum balance your husband is maintaining from last six months or three months in the account. Okay. So once we have that information with us, we do for self-employed people as well. Okay. Sure. So I'll ask you some questions if you are going to take it forward right now so that I can have your profile and give it to my ModGate advisor. Is that okay with you? Actually, what we want to do is that we want to know, that's the first time that we want to use ModGate in Dubai. So for sure, we want to know how much can we get from back and based on that, maybe we can go for more expensive, yes, more expensive will ask. Yes. And you will have an idea, like how much amount bank will finance you, and how much you have to put as a down payment. You will have a clear picture at your site. Exactly. But you know, maybe it takes some time or many months for deciding, for choosing, but this is a good idea. Yes, that is your own choice, whether you will go or not. But having an idea is not in hand, right? Yes. Yes. That's what I want to say. Okay. So you are a resident of Dubai and you want to take it on your husband's name, not your name, right? Yes. Or you want to take it jointly? No, no, it's for my husband. Husband, may I know his name, please? Yes, Mehdi M-E-H-D-I-V-I-D, D for Doug. Mehdi. Yes, Mehdi. Mehdi. M-E-H-D-I-V-I-D. No, no, D-I-M-E-H-E-I-D. Yes, Mehdi. Okay. And the family name is R-A-R-A-S-A-S-A-E-I-E-I. R-A-S-I-E. Yes. Okay. May I know his age? Yes, he is 40 years old. 40 years old. Okay. Now that he is self-employed. You have to tell me what is the turnover for monthly and what is the turnover yearly? Oh, yearly and monthly. What salary has put himself on? You know, you know, monthly, because the turnover is high, I don't know, maybe around 700,000, their hands, one million, their hands. Okay. I will put it as up to one million. Do you know, do you have any idea how much balance has been maintained from last six months or three months in your account? Last three months, I think around, if you want to consider monthly, around one million, so maybe it is around two to three million turnover. Okay. All right. And how long does business enjoy? It's two years. Two years. Okay. Any liabilities you have, like a personal loan or credit cards or car loan you have taken? We have a debit card. Debit is okay. That is your own money. I'm saying credit. Yes. No, no, no, no credit cards. No car loan. No, no. No personal loan from any bank. No, no, no. Okay. Perfect. Okay. May I know your nationality, like which passport you hold? Actually, we have two nationalities, Iranian and Dominican. But I think, yes, my husband is now under the Dominican nationality. So I will put it to the Dominican. Yes. Yes. So we spell it D-O-M-E-N-I-C-A-N. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. All right. This is the first property, right? Yes. Okay. And the price range which you're looking for is how much? Well, we were looking for a 2 million to 2.5 million. Okay. 2.2 million, 2.5 million. Okay. All right. Ms. Maryam, you will get a call from mortgage advisor if in case you are with your husband or you want to give your husband's number so that he can have directly word with the mortgage advisor. Actually, the problem is that he's not in Dubai. Oh, okay. All right. Yes. So once you will have a word with mortgage advisor, whatever he asks, if you are able to provide or you have to wait for the husband, please let him know so that he would do the same as for your convenience. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you so much for the all information. Thank you for calling. It was nice talking to you. Have a wonderful day. You too. And goodbye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",

Regarding mortgage it is. Yeah. I want to quickly ask you few questions so that I can have your profile and I will forward it to my mortgage advisor. They can take your case forward then. Okay. Okay, alright. You are a resident of Dubai, right? Yes. Meenu, how old are you? I am 36. Sorry, I didn't get you? 36. Okay, are you salaried or self-employed? Salary. Salary. How much is a salary? 18,000. 18,18. Yes. Okay, any additional income apart from this? I have some investment in Egypt but he is not one of them. Okay, okay, alright. How long have you been working with this company? 14, 15 years. 15, 14 years. Okay, any liabilities you have? Car loan, credit card? I have car loan. You have car loan? How much is that? I am paying 19,000 very much. You are paying 19,000? No, no, 1,900. 1,900 per month. Okay. Any credit card you have it? Yeah, I have almost all credit around 50,000 there. So I will consider two or three credit cards you have? Yes, yeah. Three credit cards, yeah. Yeah, that's okay, that's fine. It's just I can have your profile, yeah? So you are Egyptian as far as I got you, yeah? Okay. You hold Egyptian passport, right? This is the number four. Okay, so the property which you are planning to buy, is it ready to move in or off plan? Yeah, ready to move. Okay, and the price range is 1.1 million, right? No, 1.5. 1.5, okay. And this is going to be the first property in UAE. Right, yeah. Perfect. So what I will do is I will send all these details to my mortgage advisor. They will give you a call shortly, ask for your some documents and give you the best rates for the mortgage so that you can take it forward. Once you have the approval, you have almost 45 days to avail it to start with your property and then the mortgage is started. If you cross the period of 45 days, then you have to start it from the zero again. Oh, again, zero. Yeah. So within that period of time, please finalize the property, okay? You have signed almost two months, one and a half months. Okay, about some payments, okay? I have to have 20%. Yes, you have to pay 20% because the funds can give you only up to 80% mortgage. Okay, but once person 80% 20% it has to be currently now in our bank account. Or if I have like in 12 and once I have property, I will arrange it with money. See, what happens is say for example, you are finalizing the property, right? You went to the developer or you went to the broker, they are giving you the property, right? Then they will, you will give the expression of interest to them. Say for example, 10,000, 5,000. What is the remaining balance out of the total amount? 20% has to be paid from your side. Once the bank and the developer will see 20% has been paid by the client, then your mortgage will start. Okay. And for that, you also have some days to complete that down payment from the developer. Yeah. So you just have to check with the broker how many days you have to complete the down payment and then start the mortgage. That is up to you and... We don't have to have full amount there. Sorry? To get the initial approval, we don't, we are not required to have the full amount. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Pre-approval you can get and you will have an idea how much bank will give you and how much you have to put towards your property. Pre-approval can be done by anyone. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you. Have a lovely day.",

Ms. Emmy, I am Jurara calling you from Pripco Services. How are you doing today? I'm good. How are you? I am good. Thank you so much for asking. I have received an inquiry from Banker Real Estate that you are interested in taking mortgage for the property. You are looking for one bedroom apartment, right? Yes. Yeah. And you want to check the eligibility? Yes. Okay. I quickly have to ask you a few questions so that I can tell you and take your case forward. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. You are a resident of Dubai, right? Correct. Perfect. May I know how old are you? I am 27. 27. Are you a salary or a self-employed? Salary. How much is a salary? 13,000. 13,000. Is there any other question? Yes. Is there any other additional income you have? No. This is the dot which comes to your account every month, right? No commissions, nothing, right? No. Okay. All right. How long have you been working with this company? It will be a year in June. Almost a year. Okay. Any liabilities you have taken like car loan, loan, credit card? Nothing. No. No, no credit cards. That's good then. What's your personality? I mean, which passport you hold? Indian. Okay. All right. So the property which you're planning to buy, the Banbedroom apartment, it's ready to move in, right? If I'm not mistaken, yeah. Yeah. Okay. There's a couple of places that I'm looking at. Because you know, I'll tell you one thing, I'll suggest you one thing, go for ready to move in because it's easy to get mortgage on the ready to move in unit rather than off the mortgage. I have a question about that. So if it's ready to move in and it's easier to get a mortgage on that, but wouldn't that mean I'd pay more money for the mortgage in terms of interest rates and things like that? No, it's not that. See, how does it work is off plan, if the project is off plan, you have to wait for the 50% construction and the 50% almost payment has to be done from the client by then. Okay. So the client can put it on mortgage whereas in while the unit is ready, you have to only put down payment which is only 20% for the total value and rest up to 80% is given by the bank. And rate is not directly proportional to anything ready to move in and off plan. Rate is from the bank, pencil bank. Right now it's going down and we will ensure that we will get you the best rate and you have a choice to choose which bank you want to go with. Okay. Okay. And how much is the services from your end? It's free of charge. Oh, okay. Yes. Yes. Me and you know the price range which you're looking at. What's the price range for the property? It's between 900,000 and 1.5 million. Okay. I don't know if that's too much. Yeah, it's fine. We can try. And this is going to be the first property of yours and you. Okay. Yeah. That's pretty much it. Miss Amy, what we will do is we will give you a call from my mortgage advisors. They will take your case forward and ask you for the documents and then you will get a pre-approval as soon as possible. Okay. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much.

It's monthly 2,500 euros. 2,500 euros? Yes. It's 3,900 before taxes. Yeah, then you pay the tax and this is what remains in your account, right? Exactly, yes. Okay.

What is the balance you are maintaining from past six months in your account? My balance? Which is untouchable. I don't understand this question. I'll tell you. You mean the liquidity of money? Into euro. Yeah, I'll tell you. You'll understand. Yeah. So what I am saying is if we check your last six months balance, okay, are you maintaining 6000 euros every month? Maintaining means like getting? No, not getting. Maintaining as in which you do not touch. If say for example... Oh no, I have one account with over 60,000 euros. I have one account with 100,000 euros. Perfect. That's what it's maintained continuously from last six months, right? If we check the back state. Yeah, yeah. That's what it's made. Oh yes, yes, yes. It's like even saving. It's not saving accounts again. I can use it anytime. Exactly. But at the same time you have money there, yeah? It keeps the... Yes, yes. Oh, many years. I got it. I got it. Now, do you know which passport you hold? I mean your nationality? Austria. Austria, okay. Not Australia. Austria, I know, yeah. So the property which you're planning to buy in UAE, this is ready to move in unit, right? Yes, it's the ready unit and I was talking with your colleague, I don't know the agent, and there is an apartment for 1.75 million. 1.75 million. Which is a little bit too high for me because I don't want to spend much liquid money. Yeah. Yes. Because all properties are in Egypt, so I don't really want to spend my money. I always try to spend, or how you call it, to invest and get the rental money to pay out. Understood, understood. Pay out, yeah. So what you want to do? In Egypt you don't have mortgages, you have payment funds. Yeah. Over here you have a choice. See, for example, as a non-resident you have to pay 50% of the amount. Say for example, 1.75 is the total amount of the property. Half of this has to be paid from your side towards the property. 50%. Yes, and up to 50% you will get from the bank as a non-resident. Yes. So whatever the amount you are taking... Everybody told me 40%. So now it's... Yeah, up to 50%. See, you know how it happens, what we say the correct figure is up to 50%. Up to as in we use it, it can be 45%, it can be 47%. Based on your profile, your income profile, yeah. On that basis bank will give you up to 50%. So whatever the amount you are taking for the property, like say for example 1 million, 500,000 has to be paid from your side. Yeah. Say for example, 700,000, 350,000 has to be paid from your side. Whatever the amount you are taking in total for the property, half has to be paid from your side. As a down payment, yeah. And this is going to be the first property in Dubai, right? Yes. Okay, all right. So if you take forward your case, mortgage advisor will give you a call, they will ask for certain documents and then they will get a pre-approval for you. Once you have a pre-approval in hand, you will have a clear picture how much bank is going to give you and which, you know, price range is suitable for you to go for. Okay, perfect. Yeah, okay, that's good. Okay, all right. I think you have a lot. And how long this approval will... Pre-approval will not take much time. The moment you will give us the document, it will take five to seven working days to come in here. No, no, I mean, when I get the approval, do I have to get the property in the same week or can I... No, no, no, no, you have 45 days to avail that. Okay, perfect. That's good. Okay, all right. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a lovely day. You too, bye. Bye.",

These were the questions which I had to ask and I had to know. So what I will do here onwards, I will forward all these details to my mortgage advisor. They will give you a call for documentation and then take your case forward and get the pre-approval. But listen, one thing to note is that I'm changing jobs to apply now or after changing jobs because I'm going to go B-Bate in Abu Dhabi. And I'm currently applying for a golden visa as well. And my salary is going to become 50,000. My name is Ertugrul. I'm not sure if it will be better to apply when it becomes 50,000 or 30,000. What do you think? If it will be, wait, when are you going to change the job and when are you moving to Abu Dhabi? Which one? I will resign from my Dubai job like my last day from the end of July. Okay. And then Abu Dhabi I will start. Then you have to serve the notice period after resigning and then you will leave. No, no. I mean the notice period ends in the end of July. I'm already serving the notice period. Oh, okay. But I'll tell you, it will take only five to seven working days or even less according to your profile for the pre-approval. Okay. And then you have 45 days to avail that. That means you can do it on this basis. Okay. If we start it now. No, I mean I'd rather pay now. I'd rather start now than later. Exactly. Even with a new house. Exactly. Yes. Okay. All right. So my mortgage advisor will give you a call shortly.

How are you doing today? Hello? Jorah, how are you? I am good. Thank you so much for asking. Ms. Ahir received an inquiry from Metropolitan Real Estate that you are interested in taking mod gauge. I believe you are looking for a property here. Yeah. Yes, yeah. Yeah? Okay, all right. So I just quickly wanted to know, have you already finalized the property over here or you are still looking for the options out? Still looking for options. Still looking, okay. Are you already aware that UAE government, UAE banks, provide only 50% or 60% of mod gauge to the non-residents? Oh, okay. If you are planning to buy a property over here, 40% of the down payment or 50% of the payment has to be done from your side only. Oh, okay. The amount which they given from bank to you. Oh, so I have to have, because I said I don't have the down payment. What is the balance? It's not about this thing, what you call a resident and a non-resident has a difference. Like a person who is a resident over here will get up to 80%. A person who is not a resident will get up to 60. 60 is the max you get or 50 is the most of the banks which they are giving. The less has to be paid by the client on their own. Okay. Okay, the best I'm saying, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have, thanks. I don't have that much. Say for example, if you are taking a property worth 1 million, 1 million dirham in Dubai. 500,000 has to be from your side and 500 will be given by bank. Whatever the property value you are taking, half has to come from your side. Yeah, I don't have that much. Okay, so we are dropping the plan. Can you find me like something that I can afford? Can you just give me an idea like how much you want to invest and how much you have? I don't have anything. I just want to, like if I go there and I become a resident, yeah. And I just want to know how much. I mean, well, like I'm Canadian citizen. So if I go there and I become a resident. There are ways to become a resident, either to have your own company, to open your own company and have investors visa and get your residency. Either you invest in a property over here and you get investors visa for two years or golden visa for 10 years if you have 2 million dirham for your property. And you can come here and find a job. They will also give you a residency visa for two years and you will be a resident of Dubai then. Okay. Yes. I don't know what to, how do I open a company over there like my first time. You are going to come to Dubai and see the market and have a look how do things over there. And then take a call. Okay. I don't. Well, can you call me later? Maybe let me think it through. But like, how cheap are the, what's the cheapest property there? I'm sorry. Oh, you're breaking up. Sorry. I'm sorry. You're breaking up. I can't hear you. I'm sorry.",

I cannot give you the name but it is on my portal right now. The questions are very general. Nothing much in it. I have only had a pre-approval from MRS MBD. Okay. All right. We worked with almost 14 banks in Dubai. Okay. So what happens is we do give pre-approval as well but according to the choice of yours and give you a lot of, you know, choices from which bank you want to go with because every bank has a different rate. Every bank has different fixed rates for five years or two years and so that our client will have an idea which bank is preferred for them. So that is the reason we give pre-approval and if you have already got it from MRS MBD, you can check it from our side as well and other banks as well like Maastricht, DIB, Ambrose Islamic and... The most important thing for me is the national loan amounts because I am what I receive now is lower than I expected. So that is what I would like to have. How much is the property value? The property value itself is 6 million. 6 million? Yeah. Okay. All right. And you are aware that a bank can give you up to 80% based on your profile. What level is your credit? 70, right? Yeah. 80, 80, 80%. Okay. Yes. 80%. What level do you have like credit cards? Yeah. So I want that. I am closing everything. So it will be zero. So no personal loan, no car loan, no credit cards? No. No, I am closing everything. Okay. So I will put it as zero. Then it's fine. You will get up to exactly 80%. So I know how old are you? 40. 40. Perfect. Are you a salary or self-employed? Salary. Perfect. May I know how much is the salary? 58,000. 58, I am not wrong. 5, 8, right? Yeah. Okay. All right. How long have you been working with the current company? Almost two years. Two years.

So I have, I will explain to you. So I have one full year bonus and one bonus of several and a half months. That's an additional income. Yeah. That's a certain amount, right? Yeah. That is okay. That's fine. Your salary is almost fine. And when your documents will be taken like your pay sales or your bank statement, that will be automatically depicted there. Yeah. I want to, I want to, okay, before I go on to some old documents, because I already did it, I want to have a copy of your site. Yeah. Pre-calculation. Okay. What's more or less the money I can get. Yes. Yes. My mod advisor, my mod advisor will give you exact calculation of what and which rate is suitable for you and which bank can give you what rate. He will talk to you about everything and then he will take it forward according to your. And do you have a pay you a fee for this or just? No, no, no. It's completely free. Completely free. We have upper-owned tie-ups with bank. For you, there is no charge. No charge. I'm saying it on a recorded line. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

You want to know that? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I did, I have written as your salary like this. Once my mortgage advisor will give you a call and then you can explain them.

                "text": "conversation with Customer Swamy .: Hello. Hello. Yes. Good morning. Am I speaking to Mrs. Mami? Yes, speaking. I am Dharanar calling you from Pripko Dubai. How are you doing today? Yes, fine. Tell me. It is regarding mod dates. I have received an inquiry from Reign Real Estate that you are interested in taking mod dates. Is that correct? Oh, not yet finalised any property. So, we will be taking after the finalisation. Yes. You can take the pre-approval and have a perfect look at how much bank will finance you and what budget you should look for. Like people usually do, they go for pre-approvals and you have 45 days to avail it. Within that period of time, you can finalise the property and avail the mortgage if you take the pre-approval right now. And you will understand which bank can give you. Pre-approval with bank or with... No. Pre-approval, see. We have tie-ups with top-notch banks in Dubai. Okay. Say, for example, if you got your documents or if you had a word with us that I want this rate or any preferred bank you want to go with, what we will do is we will get you the rate and tell you how much amount they can give you, how much maximum mortgage they can give you towards property according to your profile. So, once you have that profile, once you have that pre-approval in your hand, you will have an idea which property you should go for because whatever the price range you are looking for, you have to pay 20% according to the final amount you are choosing. 20% has to be down payment for your side because for the residents banks only provide up to 80% mortgage. So, you will have a clear picture like how much bank is going to finance and how much you should be giving as a 20% and which property you should go for. And after getting pre-approval, you have 45 days to finalise the property. Exactly. Okay, okay. And you can assist in getting first pre-approval. Yes, I can assist you in that, yes. And you will have that paper with you and later when you finalise the property, you can simply avail it, start your mortgage. Okay, so, with this regard, you have any some chapters? I just have to ask you a few questions which is very general like your age and your source of income. That's it. And then I will forward it to my mortgage advisor. They will ask for the documents and take your case forward to the bank. No, no, but the 30 before doing that one, you are in charge of the company. No, no, no, there is no charge. It's completely free. You won't be charged anything from our side. Okay. Okay. So, let's go ahead with questions. Yes. Okay, all right. You are a resident of the bank. How did you get my number? We have received it from Reign Rail Estate. Okay, one hand that is in Dubai, yes, yes, yes. Okay. Okay, yeah. So, you are a resident of Dubai, right? I mean, UAE, right? Yeah. Okay. May I know how old are you? 41. 41. Okay. Are you salaried or self employed? Salaried. Salaried. May I know how much is a salary? 41,000 per month. 31, right? 41, yeah. 41. 41. Okay. All right. How long you've been working with this company? Eight years. Eight years. Any liabilities you have? I mean credit cards, card loan, personal loan? Definitely credit cards. How many, how much limit you have taken and how many credit cards you have? Putting five credit cards. Five credit cards. Can you just roughly tell me to limit how much limit you have taken? These are here, higher side limits. So, one card is 50,000, another card is 15,000, then two cards are done, another two cards are done. Let's say roughly 100K? No, it will be more than that. More than that? You are asking credit card limit, right? Yes, yes, yes, limit. Okay, because two credit cards bank themselves, they increase their credit limit. Oh, okay. I will put it as more than 100K. Correct. Okay. May I know which passports you hold? I mean your nationality? Indian. Indian. Okay. So, the property which you are looking over here, that is going to be ready to move in or off plan? Ready to move in. Perfect. May I know which price range you are looking at? Which price or size range? I mean, you might have a budget in your mind, like I want a property with this price. 1.5 to 1.9. 1.5. Like that 2 basically. 1.9. Okay. Is this going to be the first property in UAE? Yes. Okay, all right. That's pretty much it. I will share your details with my mortgage advisor. He will ask you for the documents and give you a call shortly and give you the best possible rate from different banks. And if there is any preferred bank you want to go with, they can do that for you even. And then you will have a pre-approval and can finalize the property after that. Yeah. Yeah, one missing information is I don't have any other loan liability. Yeah, I put it as like there is no liability and you just have credit cuts which are limit is this. That's it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. Have a wonderful day.",

How are you doing today? I'm fine. Good. I am good. Thank you. I have received an inquiry from Mr. Yogesh Patawari who works in Eminence state that you are interested in taking mortgage. Is that correct? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Are you still looking for the property or it's already finalized? I'm actually looking for the property in that one. I have someone who is in my mind. So I just want to know how the mortgage proposal is. Okay. All right. So it works like you are a resident, right? So any bank over here can give you mortgage up to 80%. Okay. Okay. Okay. Based on your profile and there are different rates from different banks, like rates of fluctuating and based on your profile or preference, whatever bank you want to go with, whichever bank you want to go with, you have an option you can. We can give you the pre-approval and yeah. Later you can prevail. You can avail that within 45 days. Yeah. Okay. I understand. Yeah. So what I just... Are you a resident of Dubai? I have to ask you a few questions so that I can have some profile. Yeah. I understand. The thing is that I have, I will just give you some details about me. The thing is that I'm an investor in Dubai actually. You are an investor. Yeah. We are an investor. Okay. Okay. Okay. What is the source of income? My source of income is business only. Business only. Can you just tell me what is this turnover or like monthly or year? So my business is a new setup actually. It's just how operation goes for the eight months only till now. Eight months. So I don't think that's eligible for it. So for example, it is a new business now. So it's my asset now is... What was it? What was it? Six months? Yeah. Now it's eight months. About to get it one. I'm saying till six months what it was. Sorry what? I'm saying till six months. What revenue you saw? Can you just give me figure out on basis of your six months? The first six months is hardly 30,000 or something monthly. What's my revenue for first six months? Okay. So if we say 30,000... So it was already 180,000, right? Yeah. Correct. Correct. 180,000. And if we talk about last three months bank statement, have you maintained 25,000 dirhams? Not always. It's like 15, 20, sometimes it's like what goes. So if we can like I can like prepare for it. That's also fine. Like maybe like six months if I have to manage some balances that I can do. Yeah. So what happens is once we require documents from your side, so the balance which you should have maintained from last three months should be 25,000. Like at least we should be untouchable. If it goes low then no. Yeah. That is fine only. It does. Hold. Can you just give me a minute? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Okay, then dobs and it'll be okay. Okay. Hello? Hello? Yeah, yeah, thank you. Thank you so much for holding. What I, what you know is you can get up to 60% loans. I told you to follow us, right? Yeah, because of your business, because it's very less than ours. Yeah. And on basis of that, you can get up to 60%. That is what we can do where we require less documents from your site. That is called low document mortgage. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, is that okay? Shall we proceed? Ah, so you're saying that with my right now, the state months of business itself, I can get 60% of the home loan, right? Yeah, you can get 60% of mortgage. Okay, I understand. Okay. So I just want to know one more option, whether like, what if one person salary, like my brother, he's salary here. So he got like salary around 6000. So will he able to... No, no, no, minimum salary should be 15,000. 15,000, right? Yes. Okay, okay. What about a foreigner like, you are a different country? Non-resident. Yeah, non-resident, yeah. Non-resident gets up to 50% or 60% of mortgage and the interest rate is high for them rather than a resident gets, yeah. For me, how much interest percentage will be? For you, it will start from 3.99. A Mandri. Sorry? Is it Mandri or yearly? 3.99. So 3.99 will be added to the whole amount and then for how many years you have taken the mortgage for, then they will divide the amount in how many months it is coming and then they will give you the AMIs for a month. What kind of annual isn't that right? No, you have to pay monthly but which comes very less because they will divide, yeah. Yeah, that I understood like, in the system annual basis, right? Yeah. And one more thing, is it diminishing rate or flat rate? See, what happens is there are some banks who are giving, you know, first five years they are giving certain rate which is fixed. Some banks, they are giving two years which the rate is fixed. What they say is it's going to fluctuate after that. Say two years, they say it and then after two years it can go down or it can go up according to the central bank. And there are some banks who give fixed rate for five years. So it depends which bank is going to give you mortgage and what is the offer they are currently having. Okay, okay, I totally understand. So actually I have to discuss with my family then I will give you the final confirmation. Okay. One more thing, if I have to get the loan then I have to keep a minimum balance of 25,000 untouched in my business. Yes, it should be untouchable, yeah. Okay, for three months minimum, right? Okay, yeah. And whatever the money we use that is fine, right? Yeah, for now this is fine but at least it should be more than, you know, 500,000 or like this. 100,000, I understand. Yeah, you agree. Yeah, but for now it's fine, right? Yeah, for now it's fine. Low document, up to 60% based on your profile you can get. Okay, okay, we will, okay, okay. So let me have this customer comment. Should I call you back in the same number? Yeah, you can call me or you can just tell me when I can give you a call tomorrow. Okay, okay, okay, that's fine. Okay, thank you. Thank you. All right, thank you. Have a wonderful day. Okay, bye.",

So the property which you have finalized is steady to move in? No, we took it two years ago during construction now. We are just waiting for the handover. Handover is now, yeah, in this year only. Okay. May I know the price? 1.7. And you might have done the payment towards it. How much you have done and how much you required from the mortgage? 20% is standard, 20% is paid, 80% is taken mortgage. Okay. All right. This is the first property in Dubai? Yeah, the first property in Dubai. Okay. All right. Thank you so much for the information. My mortgage advisor will give you a call tomorrow morning. They will ask for certain documents and get you the pre-approval from different banks in Dubai because we have tie-ups with top-notch banks and we will get you a rate and then you will have a choice to select with which bank with which bank you will prefer to go with. Yeah. Yeah. And you asked me how long I have been with this current company. Is that a requirement? Because some people, they change jobs. Whereas they have the salary which we can take, but they change the jobs. Then when we ask for three-month bank statement, it should be from the same company and the resignation should match. So once there is one month is missing and then they say we have changed the job but the salary is more, then we have to get the NOC from their HR that this employee is the permanent employee. Yeah, for that reason we have to ask. Yeah, but because the project has been delayed by more than one year, say two years and of course I will change jobs. So I am in a job change phase. So yeah, I don't know when the pre-approval happens. Pre-approval will happen probably in a week or lesser than that. It depends upon your profile. Yeah, I am meeting two banks this week for pre-approval. So I will get that done. So yeah, of course, only thing is I am just saying that of course a guy or a person changes jobs. I know, I know. Yeah, that is the reason we have to ask because then for that person who has changed the job we have to again wait for the three months so that we can get the new three month bank statement from the new company. Yeah, all right. All right. As of now it is all available. So yeah, just check with your mod supervisor. Yeah, then let me know. Okay, all right. Thank you for the information. Have a lovely day.

They will require some documents from your side and take your case forward. We'll give you the best rates, inshallah. Yeah. But what is the approximately amount that you all can give us? That is up to 80% you can get. Based on your profile? Yes, up to 80%. And that would be for a term off? Depends upon how much you want to take and probably 15 years, 20 years. And if you want to reduce the years, you can do that. We can do that on personal as well. Let's say if it is 15 years, what would be the monthly mortgage value? Depends upon the rate which is going on. For example, the rate right now is going from 3.99 to 5.99 or 4.99 like that. So say for example, if you go to the bank or the IB or this, say for example, they have 3.99 or 4.1. So the 4.1 will be added to the whole amount which you will be taking from the bank. And then they will divide that into how many months are there in that in those years and that will be your EMI then. Okay. And what if I repay it earlier? Will there be any reductions in the interest value? Maybe, yeah, there can be. Okay. Yeah. It's always circulating. I tried once for the credit card, I paid everything in advance and then they said like no. Credit card and mortgage is completely different. Credit card is a very small amount. Mortgage is a big amount, yeah? Okay. Okay. All right. When is the preferred time to call you? Probably around 4.30. 4.30? Okay. I will mention additional details.

How are you doing today? Doing well, thank you. Yeah, you asked me to give you a call. I quickly wanted to know you need a mod gauge, right? Yes. Okay, all right. So you live in Kuwait, right? Not here in Dubai? No, I live in Kuwait. Yeah, so you will be considered as a non-resident but GCC National? GCC National? Are you a GCC National? I am a cold-blooded national. Sorry?

Happy birthday in advance. Thank you. Are you a salivate or self-employed there? Both. Both. So which should I consider? See, if you will tell me how much is government salary, okay, let's just see your salary plus additional income. What is the salary? I need it not big, by the way. The amount for my mortgage is not huge. It's only the last 15%. Okay, fine. That is okay. Then can you just tell me how much is the salary? I don't know how to say it in UAE. No, you just tell me Kuwaiti. Don't worry about that. 3000. Okay. All right. How long have you been working with the current company? It's a government job. Government job. How long you are in that job? Five to six years. Okay. Any liabilities you have taken? I mean credit card, personal loan, car loan. I have one loan. Which loan? Personal loan? Personal zero interest loan. Personal loan with zero interest. How much is that? It's 40,000 Kuwaiti. 40,000 Kuwaiti. Okay. And it's payable over four years. Okay. And I finished one year already. Three years left. Yeah. Three years left. And I think the payments are around 850. A monthly, yeah? Yeah. Okay. So the property which you are planning to buy over here in Dubai, is it ready to move in? I rented it. You are renting it. That means it's ready. What was the price of this property? Purchase price or market price? No purchase price. The one which is on title deed. 1.38. 1.38 million. Okay. And this is the first property in UAE? First property. Perfect. That's pretty much it. Tomorrow, Mr. Yusuf, you will get a call from my mortgage advisor. Okay. I will mention in the additional details that you only require 50% of the mortgage from the UAE bank. Yeah, which is around, I'll give you that amount. Wait, wait, wait. I'll give you the amount. Yes. The amount, please stay with me. And it's payable in... Because there was 15, so what it says, it's my post payment. Okay. I had one this month, which I paid already, 15% okay. And I have another one in November. Okay. Okay. And the amount is around... The amount is around... I'm sorry, we just stay with me. Okay. Yeah, the amount is 205.3. So this is how much you want, yeah? Yeah, 205.... 233. Okay, all right. Okay. That's the remaining, still present. Okay. Okay. Okay. And I wanted on... I wanted the shortest amount of time to be paid out. What's the shortest amount? Okay. Five years, maybe, or I don't know if there is a shorter than five years. Yes, we have an option, some banks give options. And once your case will be given to them, and we will tell you which bank is giving, the shorter period, yeah? Yeah, it has to be Islamic, Sharia. Yeah, Islamic, okay. And I want to open with them a bank account for all my... Islamic loans. Okay. And I want to have a bank account with them. Sponsor to open bank account. And maybe there's another figure that is important, that I rented the apartment for 90,000 a year. Okay. That means that's the additional income. I already put it, you know, your additional income. They will be considering that as an additional income, yeah? Yeah, this is what the apartment is renting right now. I just rented it last month. It finished in December, the apartment. It's in Dubai Creek Harbor, E'Amar, it's an E'Amar project. Oh, Masha'Allah. Okay, I got it. Okay. Okay. In Dubai Creek Harbor, the... And they had a wooded in December and you put it on rent from now, yeah? I put it for sale at first. I don't want to rent. Okay. But I didn't find the number that I wanted. I only got the purchase price amount for it, original price, you know? And I just wanted to tell you the original price, so I rented it. Okay. Nice. You will have an income from that as well. Yeah. They gave you 90K, two checks. Exactly. It's perfect, fine. And then next year, if the price is Gouha, you can put it at 100K. Yeah. Because the contract is one year only. One year only, I know, yeah. And you know, it's a new area because it's a new master plan. Yeah, it's a new area. People are crazy about Creek Harbor. Yeah. So I think, you know... Yeah, the moment it will be... The moment it will be wholly developed, 100K is very less. It will touch heights. Keep in mind. It will go very high. Yeah, but still one bedroom or a studio even. See, there were apartments around... The price is there. Yeah, I'm telling you. You see this downtown Dubai, near Burj Khalifa, even the studio, it's touching heights. So same is going to be with the Creek Harbor. It's going to be massive in coming years. Yeah, inshallah. Okay, all right. Tomorrow, you will get a call from my mortgage advisor. They will give you the best rate and plus they will give you the solution of what you need. Yeah. Islamic, please. Islamic. I put it everything according to your convenience. Nothing to add from that. I want the same bank to be my... A bank account as well. Bank account. If I go to Dubai, it will be my main bank in Dubai. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Even the income from the apartment will be going there. Going to that bank account. I got it. Yeah. You will share that with the tenant who was over there. There and everything. Yeah. I got it. So, which means the mortgage which you will be taking, half of your rent will be already deducting the amount which you have to give back to the bank and half will be saving. Yeah, yeah. Perfect. For me, that's the best plan. Yeah, inshallah. Okay. Someone told me, you know, when you take mortgage in Dubai, you have to take big amounts because it's always better to take big amounts first time. Does that make a difference? I will tell you, 250, at least if nothing, minimum 250 you have to take. Okay. Now, your case is you want 200, right? They will put a request and see the special approval if we get 200. If not, then 250 at least that you can get. I don't care. I can leave the extra in the accounts. Exactly. See, 250 is the minimum. Yeah. I don't know if I should maybe at some point buy another property and have the rent for that to pay the mortgage. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to also the flexibility to do that in the future because this property is just for the money. Yeah, you should be doing that because you know, UA gives 50%. You just have to put 50% towards the property and 50% up to 60 even gives some bank gives 60% of what? Yeah, but I don't want the next property to be because this one when I bought it, you can imagine I bought it 20, 16. Okay. Off plan. Yeah, completely off plan. So because of Corona and everything that goes even more to it. It took a lot of time. Yeah. So this was the main problem for me. So if I want to take second property, I want it to be ready. Yeah, ready to go for ready to move it and a prime place. If you want to put it on rent, take a prime place. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just giving you all my thoughts. Maybe that will help you to, you know, put the right time. Yeah, exactly. I got it. I got it. I got it completely. Great. Perfect. Perfect. Thank you so much, Mr. Yusuf for giving me your information. You have a lovely evening. Amazing. What's your good name? Yuraira. Yuraira. Yuraira. Yeah. Yuraira. Yeah. Yuraira. Yuraira. Yeah. Amazing. Beautiful name. Yeah. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Thank you so much for talking to me and I hope my pleasure. My pleasure. At your service. Inshallah. Inshallah. Inshallah. Thank you.

How are you doing today? I'm well, thanks. I think we spoke yesterday, guys. Have we? Yeah, I think so. Because in my database, what it's showing is we haven't. Okay, alright. Anyway, how are you? Mr. Abia, it is regarding mod gauge. I have received an inquiry from Signature Habitat Properties from Manta Joshi that you are interested in looking to do bedroom apartment and you want mod gauge on that. Is that correct? Yes. Yeah, I'm calling you in regards to that. Have you spoken to any of my colleagues regarding this? I have heard a lot of calls the last few days. Okay, alright. But it is regarding mod gauge. Yes, yes. Yeah. So I have to ask you a few questions so that I can have your profile and my mod gauge advisor will give you a call and ask for documents. Is that okay? Yeah, sure. Okay, you are a resident of Dubai, right? Yeah. Okay, may I know how old are you? 52. Sorry? 52 years old. 52, 52, right? Yeah. Okay, are you salaried or self-employed? Salary. Salary. Okay.

We are giving services related to real estate, which includes mod gauge as well. And I have received an inquiry from Ms. Mamta Joshi, who works in Signature Habitat. So what are the findings or what do you do? Because I'm not sharing any more information on the phone. I'm sorry. Do you want my mod gauge advisor to directly give you a call because they will ask for the same information? Didn't Mamta Joshi told you that they will ask you these questions? No, she did not. I don't like to tell you, I can't remember who I spoke to. I read a lot of course. What I'm saying is I need to get something formal in writing because you're asking a lot of questions. Okay. Yeah, because we do ask these questions. These are the pre-qualification questions, which we have to know. That is fine. But I would prefer doing it differently. If you send me something on email, it's using yourself. Let me see your company profile. When I'm comfortable, then I will share my personal information. Okay, I will have a word with Ms. Mamta Joshi first and then maybe. I don't know what to do. You're not a bank, you can call us the brokers. So that's what I'm asking. That's how you should introduce and tell me the broker and stuff. Anyway, I would like to share the company profile. So far, all the calls are here. I've not shared any information. Okay, all right. Perfect. I'll do the same. Yeah, okay. Thank you. I can approach the bank directly if I want to, which I've done already. So I don't have to tell you what is the job of the broker in between. What we are doing is we can give you at the same time, we can give you a, you know, raise from different banks where you can get the different rates at the same time you have a choice. So that's how you should have to use the score. You don't just go straight out asking me a whole lot of personal questions. No, no, no, because you know the moment I ask you, I first ask you, is it okay? What is your company, what do they do? You know, there's many schemes going around and I'm not prepared to share any information on the call. Okay, all right. Okay, thanks a lot. Thanks. Good day.",

Yeah, but then it won't make much of a difference because it's very variable every month. Okay. All right. And it's in a different bank account in my case. And ma'am can I ask you one thing? Are you maintaining 25,000 dirhams every month which is not about 6 lakh or 6.5 lakhs every month should be undetected in your account? No. Some months it will be variable. It will be very variable because I have made transfers to other accounts. If we talk about last, if we talk about say for example last six months, are you able to maintain 6 lakhs? Every month won't be that way. It's variable? It is variable, yes. Because I have made payments to something and then the money has been refunded again back to me. So at the end of the month maybe that balance may not show. What will be the average balance if we say for last three months? Around 3-4 lakhs like every month. I mean like I can send you my statement if you want to. 3-4 lakhs is your average which you are maintaining? Every month it is 3-4 lakhs because some months has been 39 lakhs and all that also. Like November was I think 39-40 lakhs or something. Right. In January? And then I have taken fixed deposits in the month of January. So obviously the balance came down because I took fixed deposits worth around 35 lakhs or something like that. From my bank account I purchased 6 deposits which is in the bank only. If you want I can send you a statement of that too. That on that day you will be able to carry that the fixed deposit and the amount which has been transferred is to the fixed deposit. Okay.

So on the letterhead of the doctor I have to make a salary certificate that I am working here since this date till this date. Then you can pick more like if we say minimum is required here is 10,000. Okay. Yeah. Let's just see if the mortgage advisor can advise you the best. So you are working there in three years. But my boss will not write more salary certificates. Okay. All right. May I know your liabilities? I do not have any liabilities. No liabilities. No credit card, no personal loan, no home loan. I have full credit card but I do not use my credit card or whatever. But what is the limit you have taken on that? I have some I see in the form of a credit card. The limit you have taken on that? I have some I think 90,000 or something which is the credit card. 90K INR. Okay. That is only one. I just have one credit card. Okay. And you hold Indian card? I also think that yeah I hold an Indian card. But I think there is an increase in my limit to 6 lakhs, 20,000 or something. So not wrong. 6 lakhs? Yeah. Okay. I have been maintaining a very good balance. So I mean but I have not used a credit card. I do not use my credit card. So 6 lakh INR your limit yeah? I think that is what the bank has made it. I do not use my credit card so it does not matter to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am just putting it just for their information.

I believe I don't know I don't remember when I can provide a salary certificate. Okay. Okay. No, she is saying and she said the visa mentioned as commercial manager. This is what it mentioned in the visa right. Yeah. The current visa mentioned commercial manager. So can I have the email address of miss Fika so that I can send an email in case because I need to recheck it about this company work experience. Once I got a confirmation what we do is we send an email stating that all the information about the golden visa then there will be a link which will be mentioned in the email after going through if you're ready to go ahead then you can click on the link you can pay 2000 the room for the pre-approval. But the charges for this is 16750 dirhams for the golden visa in case if you're going for a professional visa the charges will differ. So that will be mentioned in the email but I wanted to just reconform the email address so that I can put you across with complete detail information in the email. So it's Fika.max.money the thing that I have put in the script. Let me check one minute. So for managers it will be 11500 dirhams with the charges and the email address one I'm just getting that. And she can also take a dependent right? In yes over 18 years dependent there will be charges of 8500 below 18 years it's 8000 dirhams. And how much of it goes to you guys and how much of it goes to the government? I am not sure sir because this will be dealing with the golden visa team once I put you across with the golden visa team they are the right person to give you an update on that. All right. Okay. Just give me a minute. You have to give me an email address. This is let me spell out for you. It's F for Fox, A for Apple, Y for Yankee, I for India, Q for Quebec, A for Alpha, Dot, Nancy, Alpha, Quebec, Sierra, Hotel, Bravo, Alpha, Nancy, Delta, India at gmail.com. Yes. Correct. Okay. Yes. This is the professional visa. The professional visa is the one which is based on salary right? Based on salary and based on the visa designation. Okay. So if we are going through this, this will also be a 10 year visa? Yes it is. And as the government also will get? Yes. So the difference is if you are going with the investment like a property investment that visa where you will get spouse, children, parents, maid, driver, you can like sponsor them. But in this professional visa you can sponsor only dependent below 18 or above 18. That's it. So they also get a 10 year visa and. What do you mean by dependent? Dependent means like the spouse, kids, like our children's both. Okay. But not parents and. No. So this too can be provided. But anyways, regards to this, I just wanted to clarify about with the team regards to this for three years and one year working with the same company. If we can able to get the letter, then I will send you an email which will show all the detail information about this visa listing, pricing, everything. Then if you are interested, you can pay 2000 Rump for the pre-approval. So we will be pre-qualifying by from the government once we get it done. Then the team will be in touch with you to process the, you know, reminding things. So how long does it take usually? Usually it will take like two weeks max. Two weeks for pre-approval? No, no, no, no, for complete whole process. If you get a pre-approval once it is done, it will be two weeks max. But that is why I'm not particularly, you know, sure how long exactly it will take. When I send an email, just reply back to the email. One of the agent from the Golden Visa team will be in touch with you till the process complete. He'll be the only person who will be helping you out. Okay. Okay. Anything else I can help you with sir? That's it. Thank you Mr. Mawrashay. Thank you for your time. Have a good day. You too.",

Hi, Mr. Mohbaz, this is Yafin calling from Pripko. This call is from GoldenVisa, we received a request from NSCI property stating that you're looking for Pripko. Yes, yes. I am the owner of NSCI property basically. And I work with Pripko. And my RM is Shahzad Satheel. And I had discussed this case with him and he told me that he had discussed this case with you guys. So he told me to apply through the Pripko system. Okay, now I understand that. But right now I can see in the description it's clearly mentioned that about the person details. Specifically, there is one thing which I wanted to discuss about the salary which is mentioned as 27500. Around that much, yeah. Yeah, because the minimum requirement to get the GoldenVisa based on the salary, the professional visa, is 30,000 dirhams. If not, if they have any investments of 2 million dirhams or more, they can apply for that. No, no, it doesn't have an investment. But last time when I spoke to Shahzad, he told me that sometimes they consider less than 30,000. No, sir, because this is based on the government. Because once we take down your details, we will put you across with the government, then they will approve based on the salary. If the salary says 30,000, they will not. But what I can do is I will have a word with the GoldenVisa team and I will see if there is any possibility. And even I will check about this conversation which was done before with Shahzad, you mentioned me. Yeah. Okay, I will check on that as well. If there is any possibility, surely I will get back to you again. What about the second criteria? Her education. She is a master's in the education. Yeah, that is what. There are two types of visa. One is golden, one is professional. For professional visa itself, I am talking about is 30,000 salary. For GoldenVisa, it is based on the investment of 20,000, sorry, 2 million dirhams, which is fully paid. Then they are eligible for GoldenVisa. All right. All right. So let me have a word with the team. If there is any chance of going out for within the salary you have mentioned, 27,500, surely I will get back to you and give you an update. If not, I will update the details in the system that it is not possible or possible only. All right. Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time. Have a good day, Mr. Laush. Bye.",

I'm calling you from Dubai in regards to mortgage assistance. So we receive the details from stating that you're looking for purchasing a property in UAE and you're looking for mortgage assistance. So I'd just like to take a few details of yours to check the eligibility so I can put you across with one of the mortgage advisor to her in the call back. Okay, why is that? Okay, so as I can see that as for the comments, it's mentioned you are living in Canada and so it means like you are a non-resident.

And usually since you are a non-resident which you can get like 50% of the property value as a mortgage. Let's say you say like your budget is 800 so you can get up to 400,000 as a mortgage loan from the banks and 400 you have to pay it from your pocket. And apart from that. What is your residence? Sorry I didn't understand that question. It's from a residence for example. Okay. If it is a resident then you can get up to 80%. What if I get residences? I think it's like 2000 dollars. Residence in the sense like if you are working in UAE and you are having an Emirates ID then you will be considered as resident in UAE. And then if you are applying for that then based on the salary we can get up to 80% of your property value. If you are working in a country that is a resident in UAE? That will be based on your investments. If you have 2 million dirhams fully paid you can get a golden visa which will be for 10 years. Yeah, but the residency you can choose by residency. It can affect 2000 dollars. No, I'm not aware of it but for the visa services I would recommend you to be in check with any of the specific travel agencies who will help you with that. But right now after the UAE bank loss if you have a residency in UAE you can get 80% of the property value. And if you are non-resident you can get up to 50% or sometimes it's based on the document subject approval you can get up to maximum of 75%. So the visa service will be subject to approval. Yeah, so I cannot confirm. I'm not sure about those documents. But as per my knowledge 50 is the one which we are giving. But sometimes based on like if the bank have a specific qualification I'm not sure that you can check with the mortgage advisor which I'm assigning to you so that he will be giving you the update. If there is any possibility based on your documents he will let you know if it can be increased or not. But 50 is the one like a basic which can be provided. So I will forward this details. You will be getting a call as soon as possible from the team and who can help in getting the information about the mortgage. Are they able to communicate via email? Email or WhatsApp? Do you have WhatsApp number? The same number? Yeah, same number. I will mention that in case if you are not reachable I will ask them to drop a WhatsApp message so you can be interested with them through WhatsApp. Even in the later hours they can assist you on that.

It's like they have any credit card, personal loan, auto loan in UAE with any of the banks? No, like it wasn't there in the, in this form or. I think that because there is a liability tabs there that doesn't fill up anything in it. So I just wanted to check with them if they have any credit card. If yes, check what is the total outstanding of the card or the limit of the card. Like if they have three cards, all the limits together total. Okay. If they have personal loan, what is the remaining amount to be paid outstanding? Same like the auto loan. So this thing, if you can able to get me, I can just put you across with the mortgage advisor directly. And I'm talking to Yasin, right? Yes, Yasin. Okay, Yasin. Okay, done. I'll do that.

Hi, this is Yasin calling from Pripko. I am calling to charge the mortgage assistance as we receive your details from, you know, Revolve Reality. Yes, yes, yes. So, it's mentioned that you are looking for, you know, mortgage assistance. So, I am just calling you to pre-qualify, you know, pre-screening first. So, once it is done, I can put you across with the mortgage advisor. So, I just need a few details to understand what type of property you're looking for and what is your current salary. Okay, I'll tell you. I have already seen a property which I am taking and I have done the booking. So, it isn't by land and the handover is in October 2023. The building is 95% completely ready. It's there. The last things are going on. October 2023? Yeah. Now I need the mortgage on that, like 20% I have, 80% mortgage I need. So, what can be done? Okay, let me explain you. There are two options. One is for off plan, one is for ready to move in. So, the property which you're looking for is off plan property. So, still it's not 100% completed. You don't have the title date in hand. It means it's considered as off plan. So, as per the off plan properties in UAE, the banks can give only 50% of the mortgage value. If you have ready to move in 100% completed, if you have a title date in hand, then it means you can get up to 80% of the property value. Okay. So, as you mentioned, you have already 20% in hand and you are looking for 80%. Yeah. So, for that you need to wait till the property is hand over and then you get the title date and only you can request for 80%. Okay. Even if we say if I put 30% from my size, 70% I am looking for, so that is not possible right now. No madam, still it is not because only 50%, up to 50% that is also not full 50% based on your DBR. Okay. So, in case if you want to go for 80% then you need to wait till the construction is completed. But you guys can go do the valuation and everything, the building is already there, it's almost done. No, I understand that. So, for that we have a dedicated application where you can check any property hand over stage. So, only we can consider 100% when you have a title date in hand. Okay. Because when we are processing the loan, we need a title date document as one of the documents to process your application. So, 50% you can do right now? Yeah, up to 50%. Up to 50% okay. And how many days does it take to get it done? No, right now I am just getting few details, that's a pre-screening process. Then I can forward your details to ModGageAdvisor who will be contacting you on next working day. He will be the right person to give you the details about interest rate, what is the maximum amount you can go for all the details. Once you are okay to proceed further, the other one who will be processing your request. Okay. So, if you want I can just take down few details I can put you across if you are okay to go ahead with 50%. Yeah, yeah please. So, you are resident in UAE or non-resident? Resident. And you are salary-read or self-employed? Salary-read. And you are current salary right now? It's 20,000 plus. Make it the exact or can I mention 20? You can mention 20,000 monthly. 23. Okay. How long you have been working with the company? It's been like, I can't tell you all the details but... Approximately one year, two years, three years. You can take as of two, three years. Okay, I consider us two years and may I know your age please? 33. Okay. And do you have any liabilities in UAE? Any credit card, personal loan or total loan? Not at all. No. Okay. And may I know your nationality please? Indian. Okay. And the property you are looking for off-plan and the price of the property please? The price of the property is 7,000,000. 700,000? 700,000.

So last year only I changed my company but in UAE I worked for 5 years. Okay.

May know your liabilities please? If you have any in UAE like credit cards, personal loan, loan card. What is the total limit of the cards? It is 38,000. 38,000 altogether. Yeah. Okay. I have only one card. Okay. And your nationality please? Indian. Okay. And the property which you're looking for it's ready to move in or off plan? Off plan. Off plan. Okay. All right. And what is the price of the property you're looking for? 1.7 million. 1.7 million. Okay. Yeah. And this is your first property in UAE? Yes. Okay. What is the rate of purchase will be as soon as possible once you get. Okay. Let me give you some information about this off plan since you have selected off plan. So you can take only maximum up to 50% of the property value if you're going for the off plan. Okay. If you're going for ready to move in. Okay. So the property also should be completed at least 50% for the off plan more than 50% to get the value of between 50 to 80% you can get it. Okay. That is based on the house how much of the property is completed. Okay. Okay. That I am not sure. But if you're going for ready to move in property then you can get up to 80% of the property value. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So I have actually two properties in mind. Okay. One is I mean both of them are off plan but the first one which I am talking about it's ready. It's I think 90% ready because the handover is in the end of July. Okay. So that is almost ready. The other one which I am talking about that is that is actually completing after three years. Three years. Okay. I don't think so it will be 50% ready. Then you can go for the first option which you mentioned which is the handover in few days I mean few months. So you can go for that you can get between 50 to 80% of the property value as mortgage and reminding you have to pay as a down payment reminding value. But what I can do is since you have given these details I can put you across with one of the mortgage advisor who will be contacting you shortly by tomorrow's also you can expect to call back by Monday from the team and they can give you the information they will ask you for few documents and they will have a word with the banks all the banks in the UAE whichever is connected with and they will give you the best offer. You can decide which one you like to go for based on your decision then we will proceed according. Okay. No but I have one question here. So the property is off plan right. So you can give me this mortgage or 50 to 80% value only after the handover right. No no no. In between that also you can yes this will be the reason being I will tell you the story behind it. Let me stop you there why I am giving you an information that I will put you across with the mortgage advisor because we are not the right person to discuss about these things even we are not having exact clarity on this because if I say something later on they will say something else but surely when you get a call if you have any doubts clarification do let them know because they are the only person who will be getting this done till you get the mortgage in hand. The same person will be helping you out. Okay. So I would like to please wait for a day or two so that you can get a call back from the team and they will assist you on that. Okay no problem.

But sooner, I will get one... I will need to get a loan. Okay. For the mortgage, right? For the property? Yes. Yes. But it is still not sure the property. That is why I wondered who told you that I purchased... But did you... No. Like discuss about this to any of the agencies? Like any real estate? No. Never. Never. Okay. But I am not... Maybe someone... I don't know from where did he pick the information. Yeah. Maybe from some broker. They have given the update? I am not dealing with the broker. But look, many people are calling me offering something. But... Okay. No problem. Look, for curiosity, I can understand more about your services. Okay. I have never been reshared by anyone or never know anyone. Just in general, I would like to have information. Sure. I will mention the same update here. But what we do is we just take few details of yours to check the eligibility. Like you are working here or you are self-employed or you are working outside the country. Based on that, we will see like whether you are applicable to KDAB mortgage. Then, if you are okay to proceed further, then we will put you across with one of the mortgage advisor who will be... I am not the mortgage advisor. No. We are just pre-qualifying the clients first. Then we have a dedicated team because let's say if you are not eligible, then we will not put you across. So we will immediately say after that this is the requirement. Let's say if you have salary, the salary should be minimum of 10,000 dirhams if you are working in UAE. So same like that in case if you are self-employed. Okay. Understood. Understood. Understood. So if you are looking for mortgage assistance, surely I can take down few details and then I can put you across with the mortgage advisor. So even we can follow up in the future once you are okay to proceed further, then we will look into the mortgage from the banks. Okay. So take me the details and put me in contact with one. But don't mention that I was risk-nored by anyone because this is not the reality. I will never talk to anyone or never ask for someone to call me on this. Okay. I will mention that in the comments stating that you have not referred by any of the agencies. Okay. And never accept to share my contact details also. Sure. I will mention that. So you are a resident in UAE, right? I am sorry? Are you a resident? You are working here in UAE? Yes, yes, yes. Okay. And you are salaried or self-employed? Salaried. Salaried. What is your current salary right now? It's a coincidentally. I cannot share it with you but it's ... Approximately. You can say between this to this so that I can understand because it should not be less than 10,000. That's why I'm asking. It's much more. Much more. Like 20 to 30? More. 30 to 40? Even a little bit more. Okay. I will consider 40 approximately. Okay. Okay. And how long you are working with the company? How many years? Eight years. Eight years. Wonderful. And may know your age please? 42. 42. Okay. Great. Do you have any other questions? No. Okay. Okay. Only you have credit card. What is the total limit altogether in the credit card? 15,000. 15,000.

Do you have any liabilities in UAE like any credit cards, personal loan, auto loan, any outstanding in it? Okay. And mostly the property which you are looking for, it's ready to move in property or off plan? Off plan and ready. Okay. Let me give you some explanation here. Okay. If you are going with ready to move in property, you can get a mortgage value of up to 80% of the property value. 20% you will pay from your hand. I know. I know. Okay. I have this 20 to 30% down. Okay. In case if you are going for off plan property, the property should be completed at least understood. Understood. I know this information. Okay. Let's say that I will have this ready next year for example, what is the requirement? Okay. Then also. Let's say now. So. No, no, no. Let's say I will buy it now. Ready to move in? What is that? Yes, yes. Okay. If it is ready to move in, then you can get up to 80%. If it is offline, the property should be completed at least 60% or more. Understood. Okay. 60% completion letter. Yes. Minimum it should be because there is an application called Dubai rest. This is from Dubai government. So. So. It is from a different Emirates, not from Dubai. Dubai. If it is different Emirates, no issues. We can get the confirmation letter from the government directly that this property has been completed this much. Then yes, we can proceed further or you can get the letter from the construction, you know, contractor and you can give it to us like 60% is completed based on that the bank will decide how much can be known like either 60% or 70% or 80% based on the construction. Okay. Okay. And the property price, how much will be approximately 2.5 million. 2.5 million. Okay. This is this will be a first property in UAE. Yes. This property. Okay. And we are planning to purchase any specific time frame like after two months or three months. As soon as I find it, as soon as you find it. Okay. These are the information I required as of now. So as per the details which you have given, I can see that you are qualified to go for you know, the loan. But the only thing is about the property off plan or ready to move in as I mentioned before in case if you are looking out for the property off plan, make sure that it is completed at least 60% or more so that it will be more easier to get the loan from the banks. Hello. Hello. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So right now I have taken on all the details.
