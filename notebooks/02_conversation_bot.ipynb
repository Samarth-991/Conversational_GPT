Sir, I am calling you in regards to mortgage assistance. As we receive your details from Maftar Al-Shad properties from Mosin Ibrahim stating that you are planning to purchase a property and you are looking for mortgage. Who? This is from Maftar Al-Shad properties. Name called Mosin Ibrahim. Who is this? This is the... Never heard about this name. Okay. Have been looking out for any property to be purchased in UAE and looking for mortgage assistance? No. I do not think so. I have never heard about this name before even. Because they are the one they see. So, we receive the details from them stating that you are looking for a property purchase and you are looking for mortgage assistance on it. So, that is the reason for the call. Yes. But in general, I am looking for a property that is not for the kind of being assistance on mortgage. So... What we do is as a Pripko, we are dealing with multiple banks. We will assist you in getting offers from multiple banks and you can decide which bank you would like to proceed for. But sooner, I will get one... I will need to get a loan. Okay. For the mortgage, right? For the property? Yes. Yes. But it is still not sure the property. That is why I wondered who told you that I purchased... But did you... No. Like discuss about this to any of the agencies? Like any real estate? No. Never. Never. Okay. But I am not... Maybe someone... I don't know from where did he pick the information. Yeah. Maybe from some broker. They have given the update? I am not dealing with the broker. But look, many people are calling me offering something. But... Okay. No problem. Look, for curiosity, I can understand more about your services. Okay. I have never been reshared by anyone or never know anyone. Just in general, I would like to have information. Sure. I will mention the same update here. But what we do is we just take few details of yours to check the eligibility. Like you are working here or you are self-employed or you are working outside the country. Based on that, we will see like whether you are applicable to KDAB mortgage. Then, if you are okay to proceed further, then we will put you across with one of the mortgage advisor who will be... I am not the mortgage advisor. No. We are just pre-qualifying the clients first. Then we have a dedicated team because let's say if you are not eligible, then we will not put you across. So we will immediately say after that this is the requirement. Let's say if you have salary, the salary should be minimum of 10,000 dirhams if you are working in UAE. So same like that in case if you are self-employed. Okay. Understood. Understood. Understood. So if you are looking for mortgage assistance, surely I can take down few details and then I can put you across with the mortgage advisor. So even we can follow up in the future once you are okay to proceed further, then we will look into the mortgage from the banks. Okay. So take me the details and put me in contact with one. But don't mention that I was risk-nored by anyone because this is not the reality. I will never talk to anyone or never ask for someone to call me on this. Okay. I will mention that in the comments stating that you have not referred by any of the agencies. Okay. And never accept to share my contact details also. Sure. I will mention that. So you are a resident in UAE, right? I am sorry? Are you a resident? You are working here in UAE? Yes, yes, yes. Okay. And you are salaried or self-employed? Salaried. Salaried. What is your current salary right now? It's a coincidentally. I cannot share it with you but it's ... Approximately. You can say between this to this so that I can understand because it should not be less than 10,000. That's why I'm asking. It's much more. Much more. Like 20 to 30? More. 30 to 40? Even a little bit more. Okay. I will consider 40 approximately. Okay. Okay. And how long you are working with the company? How many years? Eight years. Eight years. Wonderful. And may know your age please? 42. 42. Okay. Great. Do you have any other questions? No. Okay. Okay. Okay. Only you have credit card. What is the total limit altogether in the credit card? 15,000.

And mostly the property which you're looking for, it's ready to move in property or off plan? Off plan and ready. Okay. Let me give you some explanation here. Okay. If you're going with ready to move in property, you can get a mortgage value of up to 80% of the property value. 20% you will pay from your hand. I know. I know. Okay. I have this 20 to 30% down. Okay. In case if you're going for off plan property, the property should be completed at least understood. Understood. I know this information. Okay. Okay. Let's say that I will have this ready next year for example, what is the requirement? Okay. Then also. Let's say now. So. No, no, no. Let's say I will buy it now. Ready to move in? What is that? Yes, yes. Okay. If it is ready to move in, then you can get up to 80%. If it is offline, the property should be completed at least 60% or more. Understood. Okay. 60% completion letter. Yes. Minimum it should be because there is an application called Dubai rest. This is from Dubai government. So. So. It is from a different Emirates, not from Dubai. Dubai. If it is different Emirates, no issues. We can get the confirmation letter from the government directly that this property has been completed this much. Then yes, we can proceed further or you can get the letter from the construction, you know, contractor and you can give it to us like 60% is completed based on that the bank will decide how much can be known like either 60% or 70% or 80% based on the construction. Okay. Okay. And the property price, how much will be approximately 2.5 million. 2.5 million. Okay. This is this will be a first property in UAE. Yes. This property. Okay. And we are planning to purchase any specific time frame like after two months or three months. As soon as I find it, as soon as you find it. Okay. These are the information I required as of now. So as per the details which you have given, I can see that you are qualified to go for you know, the loan. But the only thing is about the property off plan or ready to move in as I mentioned before in case if you are looking out for the property off plan, make sure that it is completed at least 60% or more so that it will be more easier to get the loan from the banks.

See basically she has been working in the company for three four years but before she was on a contract like a third party visa. Okay. And this visa has been more than one year. So with this visa it's more than one year. Yes. Okay. Let me check on that. Can I put you on hold for a minute please? Yeah. We should be completing on the same visa for three years. So since you said the visa has been changed with the same company then I will I need to recheck it out again on that. See the first I will explain to you so she works in Bay Curricules. Okay. Sorry what company name? Her company name is Bay Curricules. Let me tell that also we Bay the aka ER. Okay. Then space HUD HES. HES. Okay. Okay. So she has been in this company for four years. Four years okay. But before she was on a third party visa. So her visa was before from a company called Meetup. After that a company called Transguard and then she got a visa from Bay Curricules. But she has been in the same company, same team. Okay. Yes. So we can arrange an experience letter or we can arrange a letter which shows that we have she has been working in the same team. So that is why I just wanted to reconform if they can accept this with the letter if we can provide then I can just okay. Meanwhile, let me keep this separately. I just need few more details based on that I can just update the details in the system. So four years is completed as per your confirmation and the salary is exact 27500 or any other No, no. Salary has been 27500 from January last year. January 2022. January 2022 27500. It was first 26 something then it got increased to 27500. From January. I believe I don't know I don't remember when I can provide a salary certificate. Okay. Okay. No, she is saying and she said the visa mentioned as commercial manager. This is what it mentioned in the visa right. Yeah. The current visa mentioned commercial manager. So can I have the email address of miss Fika so that I can send an email in case because I need to recheck it about this company work experience. Once I got a confirmation what we do is we send an email stating that all the information about the golden visa then there will be a link which will be mentioned in the email after going through if you're ready to go ahead then you can click on the link you can pay 2000 the room for the pre-approval. But the charges for this is 16750 dirhams for the golden visa in case if you're going for a professional visa the charges will differ. So that will be mentioned in the email but I wanted to just reconform the email address so that I can put you across with complete detail information in the email. So it's Fika.max.money the thing that I have put in the script. Let me check one minute. So for managers it will be 11500 dirhams with the charges and the email address one I'm just getting that. And she can also take a dependent right? In yes over 18 years dependent there will be charges of 8500 below 18 years it's 8000 dirhams. And how much of it goes to you guys and how much of it goes to the government? I am not sure sir because this will be dealing with the golden visa team once I put you across with the golden visa team they are the right person to give you an update on that. All right. Okay. Just give me a minute. You have to give me an email address. This is let me spell out for you. It's F for Fox, A for Apple, Y for Yankee, I for India, Q for Quebec, A for Alpha, Dot, Nancy, Alpha, Quebec, Sierra, Hotel, Bravo, Alpha, Nancy, Delta, India at gmail.com. Yes. Correct. Okay. Yes. This is the professional visa. The professional visa is the one which is based on salary right? Based on salary and based on the visa designation. Okay. So if we are going through this, this will also be a 10 year visa? Yes it is. And as the government also will get? Yes. So the difference is if you are going with the investment like a property investment that visa where you will get spouse, children, parents, maid, driver, you can like sponsor them. But in this professional visa you can sponsor only dependent below 18 or above 18. That's it. So they also get a 10 year visa and. What do you mean by dependent? Dependent means like the spouse, kids, like our children's both. Okay. But not parents and. No. So this too can be provided. But anyways, regards to this, I just wanted to clarify about with the team regards to this for three years and one year working with the same company. If we can able to get the letter, then I will send you an email which will show all the detail information about this visa listing, pricing, everything. Then if you are interested, you can pay 2000 Rump for the pre-approval. So we will be pre-qualifying by from the government once we get it done. Then the team will be in touch with you to process the, you know, reminding things. So how long does it take usually? Usually it will take like two weeks max. Two weeks for pre-approval? No, no, no, no, for complete whole process. If you get a pre-approval once it is done, it will be two weeks max. But that is why I'm not particularly, you know, sure how long exactly it will take. When I send an email, just reply back to the email. One of the agent from the Golden Visa team will be in touch with you till the process complete. He'll be the only person who will be helping you out. Okay. Okay. Anything else I can help you with sir? That's it. Thank you Mr. Mawrashay. Thank you for your time. Have a good day. You too.\n",

      " Hello, how are you? Good afternoon. Can I speak to Ms Pratik Shah Shetty? Yes, hi. Tell me. Hi, this is Yasin calling from Pripko. I am calling to charge the mortgage assistance as we receive your details from, you know, Revolve Reality. Yes, yes, yes. So, it's mentioned that you are looking for, you know, mortgage assistance. So, I am just calling you to pre-qualify, you know, pre-screening first. So, once it is done, I can put you across with the mortgage advisor. So, I just need a few details to understand what type of property you're looking for and what is your current salary. Okay, I'll tell you. I have already seen a property which I am taking and I have done the booking. So, it isn't by land and the handover is in October 2023. The building is 95% completely ready. It's there. The last things are going on. October 2023? Yeah. Now I need the mortgage on that, like 20% I have, 80% mortgage I need. So, what can be done? Okay, let me explain you. There are two options. One is for off plan, one is for ready to move in. So, the property which you're looking for is off plan property. So, still it's not 100% completed. You don't have the title date in hand. It means it's considered as off plan. So, as per the off plan properties in UAE, the banks can give only 50% of the mortgage value. If you have ready to move in 100% completed, if you have a title date in hand, then it means you can get up to 80% of the property value. Okay. So, as you mentioned, you have already 20% in hand and you are looking for 80%. Yeah. So, for that you need to wait till the property is hand over and then you get the title date and only you can request for 80%. Okay. Even if we say if I put 30% from my size, 70% I am looking for, so that is not possible right now. No madam, still it is not because only 50%, up to 50% that is also not full 50% based on your DBR. Okay. So, in case if you want to go for 80% then you need to wait till the construction is completed. But you guys can go do the valuation and everything, the building is already there, it's almost done. No, I understand that. So, for that we have a dedicated application where you can check any property hand over stage. So, only we can consider 100% when you have a title date in hand. Okay. Because when we are processing the loan, we need a title date document as one of the documents to process your application. So, 50% you can do right now? Yeah, up to 50%. Up to 50% okay. And how many days does it take to get it done? No, right now I am just getting few details, that's a pre-screening process. Then I can forward your details to ModGageAdvisor who will be contacting you on next working day. He will be the right person to give you the details about interest rate, what is the maximum amount you can go for all the details. Once you are okay to proceed further, the other one who will be processing your request. Okay. So, if you want I can just take down few details I can put you across if you are okay to go ahead with 50%. Yeah, yeah please. So, you are resident in UAE or non-resident? Resident. And you are salary-read or self-employed? Salary-read. And you are current salary right now? It's 20,000 plus. Make it the exact or can I mention 20? You can mention 20,000 monthly. 23. Okay. How long you have been working with the company? It's been like, I can't tell you all the details but... Approximately one year, two years, three years. You can take as of two, three years. Okay, I consider us two years and may I know your age please? 33. Okay. And do you have any liabilities in UAE? Any credit card, personal loan or total loan? Not at all. No. Okay.

So we receive the details from stating that you're looking for purchasing a property in UAE and you're looking for mortgage assistance. So I'd just like to take a few details of yours to check the eligibility so I can put you across with one of the mortgage advisor to her in the call back. Okay, why is that? Okay, so as I can see that as for the comments, it's mentioned you are living in Canada and so it means like you are a non-resident. And I wanted to know have you finalized any properties or still looking out in UAE? Numbers. Search numbers. Still searching. And is it ready to move in property or off plan?

And usually since you are a non-resident which you can get like 50% of the property value as a mortgage. Let's say you say like your budget is 800 so you can get up to 400,000 as a mortgage loan from the banks and 400 you have to pay it from your pocket. And apart from that. What is your residence? Sorry I didn't understand that question. It's from a residence for example. Okay. If it is a resident then you can get up to 80%. What if I get residences? I think it's like 2000 dollars. Residence in the sense like if you are working in UAE and you are having an Emirates ID then you will be considered as resident in UAE. And then if you are applying for that then based on the salary we can get up to 80% of your property value. If you are working in a country that is a resident in UAE? That will be based on your investments. If you have 2 million dirhams fully paid you can get a golden visa which will be for 10 years. Yeah, but the residency you can choose by residency. It can affect 2000 dollars. No, I'm not aware of it but for the visa services I would recommend you to be in check with any of the specific travel agencies who will help you with that. But right now after the UAE bank loss if you have a residency in UAE you can get 80% of the property value. And if you are non-resident you can get up to 50% or sometimes it's based on the document subject approval you can get up to maximum of 75%. So the visa service will be subject to approval. Yeah, so I cannot confirm. I'm not sure about those documents. But as per my knowledge 50 is the one which we are giving. But sometimes based on like if the bank have a specific qualification I'm not sure that you can check with the mortgage advisor which I'm assigning to you so that he will be giving you the update. If there is any possibility based on your documents he will let you know if it can be increased or not. But 50 is the one like a basic which can be provided. So I will forward this details. You will be getting a call as soon as possible from the team and who can help in getting the information about the mortgage. Are they able to communicate via email? Email or WhatsApp? Do you have WhatsApp number? The same number? Yeah, same number. I will mention that in case if you are not reachable I will ask them to drop a WhatsApp message so you can be interested with them through WhatsApp. Even in the later hours they can assist you on that.

And my RM is Shahzad Satheel. And I had discussed this case with him and he told me that he had discussed this case with you guys. So he told me to apply through the Pripko system.

Specifically, there is one thing which I wanted to discuss about the salary which is mentioned as 27500. Around that much, yeah. Yeah, because the minimum requirement to get the GoldenVisa based on the salary, the professional visa, is 30,000 dirhams. If not, if they have any investments of 2 million dirhams or more, they can apply for that. No, no, it doesn't have an investment. But last time when I spoke to Shahzad, he told me that sometimes they consider less than 30,000. No, sir, because this is based on the government. Because once we take down your details, we will put you across with the government, then they will approve based on the salary. If the salary says 30,000, they will not. But what I can do is I will have a word with the GoldenVisa team and I will see if there is any possibility. And even I will check about this conversation which was done before with Shahzad, you mentioned me. Yeah. Okay, I will check on that as well. If there is any possibility, surely I will get back to you again. What about the second criteria? Her education. She is a master's in the education. Yeah, that is what. There are two types of visa. One is golden, one is professional. For professional visa itself, I am talking about is 30,000 salary. For GoldenVisa, it is based on the investment of 20,000, sorry, 2 million dirhams, which is fully paid. Then they are eligible for GoldenVisa. All right. All right. So let me have a word with the team. If there is any chance of going out for within the salary you have mentioned, 27,500, surely I will get back to you and give you an update. If not, I will update the details in the system that it is not possible or possible only. All right. Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time. Have a good day, Mr. Laush. Bye.\n",
