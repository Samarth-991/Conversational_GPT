You can get it as a self-employed as well, but it depends upon what is the turnover of the company, how long is the business in UAE plus, what is the balance maintained from last six months in the count. On that basis, you get as a self-employed as well. So, if we put salary, how much is the salary? 20. 20. Yeah, I will put 20 and additional income as well because you might have... Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

Carlo is how much? I mean, what is the EMI monthly? 3.7 thousand. 3.7 thousand. Okay. And what is the limit you have taken on Credit Cards? I have one which has the limit of 20 and the limit of 40. 40. That is... that's it. You have only two Credit Cards. Yeah. Actives, two. Okay. All right. That's it. No personal loan. No. Okay.

I will forward your details to my mortgage advisors. They will give you a call maybe today or tomorrow morning or on Monday. They will take your case forward. They will ask you for certain documents and then give you the choice of going with which bank you are preferring to. And that's it. We will get the pre-approval from the bank. Yeah? Perfect. Okay.

So I have got a business here and I am keen to invest some money in Dubai to buy a couple of properties, two or three. I am also just mortgage. The highest percentage I can get is better for me. So then that means instead of one I can get two, instead of two I can get four. Okay. So I am just going to ask you. I am really sorry to interrupt you. So I just need to get few basic information like the same what you are giving to me. I just wanted to get it separately separately. So as per the understanding you are a non resident in UAE and you are running a business which is self employed. No, it is not self employed. It is a limited company. Okay. But are you getting a salary or you are getting a percentage from a company? I am getting dividends. Dividend. Yeah. Okay. So the company is under whose name like since you said because I am not aware of this particular company which you are talking about. So can you just explain me little bit about it like how is it work? What do you mean? Because here in UAE there are two options either self employed or salary. So if you are not working as a salary person since you are under the company like you are running a business or as you mentioned something else. So I wanted to know like you are a partner of some company like you have three, four partners in one company something like that? No, no. I am the owner of the company. You are the owner of the company. Wonderful. So I like to know what is the turnover of your company? Approximately 200k. 200k. 200k pounds. Yeah. Yearly. Yeah. Okay. And how long you are running this business? It has been for the last six, seven years now. Seven years. Okay. Do you hold any liabilities in UAE or in London? No. Yes? No, no. No. Okay. And Meno your nationality please. What is the past current portfolio holding? Yeah. Okay. And the property which you are planning to purchase is ready to move in property or off plan? I am open for both and I am not decided yet. Sorry? I am not decided yet. It could be either. I am not decided yet. Because I just wanted to notify you something before going yet because if you are planning to go for off plan there is no option for you know foreigners like the non-resident in UAE. Only you can go for ready to move in property where you can get up to 50% of the mortgage value based on what is the property you are going for. Yeah. Okay. And what is the price you are expecting like approximately the property value? 1.4 million dirhams. Sorry? 1.4 million. 1.4 million dirhams. Yeah. Okay. And this will be your first property in UAE? Yeah. Okay. And one last thing is Mena your age please? It is 39. 39. Okay. And when you are planning to purchase this property you have any plans to come over here on any specific time frame? Or once you get the detail about mortgage then you will decide about it? I will not be moving there. But I will apply for golden visa at some point. Okay. So you are looking for golden visa as well? Yeah. Okay. Have you already applied or still you are looking for it because we can assist you in golden visa as well? I haven't started the process yet. Okay. Because the golden visa procedure is you should be having an investment of 2 million dirhams or more which is fully paid then you will be eligible for golden visa. Yeah. But I am not willing to do any investment until I know about mortgage. Okay. Okay. So right now since I got the complete information I will forward these details to one of the mortgage advisor who will be contacting you by tomorrow and they will help you in giving you more detailed information about what is the percentage you are going to get, what will be the EMI, all the detailed information then you can decide what is the next step has to be taken whether you like to process or not. Up to that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Great. Anything else I may help you with sir? No. That's it. Thank you. Thank you Mr. LaRica Rehman. Thank you for your time. Have a good day. Thank you. Thank you.

Sir, I am calling you in regards to mortgage assistance. As we receive your details from Maftar Al-Shad properties from Mosin Ibrahim stating that you are planning to purchase a property and you are looking for mortgage. Who? This is from Maftar Al-Shad properties. Name called Mosin Ibrahim. Who is this? This is the... Never heard about this name. Okay. Have been looking out for any property to be purchased in UAE and looking for mortgage assistance? No. I do not think so. I have never heard about this name before even. Because they are the one they see. So, we receive the details from them stating that you are looking for a property purchase and you are looking for mortgage assistance on it. So, that is the reason for the call. Yes. But in general, I am looking for a property that is not for the kind of being assistance on mortgage. So... What we do is as a Pripko, we are dealing with multiple banks. We will assist you in getting offers from multiple banks and you can decide which bank you would like to proceed for. But sooner, I will get one... I will need to get a loan. Okay. For the mortgage, right? For the property? Yes. Yes. But it is still not sure the property. That is why I wondered who told you that I purchased... But did you... No. Like discuss about this to any of the agencies? Like any real estate? No. Never. Never. Okay. But I am not... Maybe someone... I don't know from where did he pick the information. Yeah. Maybe from some broker. They have given the update? I am not dealing with the broker. But look, many people are calling me offering something. But... Okay. No problem. Look, for curiosity, I can understand more about your services. Okay. I have never been reshared by anyone or never know anyone. Just in general, I would like to have information. Sure. I will mention the same update here. But what we do is we just take few details of yours to check the eligibility. Like you are working here or you are self-employed or you are working outside the country. Based on that, we will see like whether you are applicable to KDAB mortgage. Then, if you are okay to proceed further, then we will put you across with one of the mortgage advisor who will be... I am not the mortgage advisor. No. We are just pre-qualifying the clients first. Then we have a dedicated team because let's say if you are not eligible, then we will not put you across. So we will immediately say after that this is the requirement. Let's say if you have salary, the salary should be minimum of 10,000 dirhams if you are working in UAE. So same like that in case if you are self-employed. Okay. Understood. Understood. Understood. So if you are looking for mortgage assistance, surely I can take down few details and then I can put you across with the mortgage advisor. So even we can follow up in the future once you are okay to proceed further, then we will look into the mortgage from the banks. Okay. So take me the details and put me in contact with one. But don't mention that I was risk-nored by anyone because this is not the reality. I will never talk to anyone or never ask for someone to call me on this. Okay. I will mention that in the comments stating that you have not referred by any of the agencies. Okay. And never accept to share my contact details also. Sure. I will mention that. So you are a resident in UAE, right? I am sorry? Are you a resident? You are working here in UAE? Yes, yes, yes. Okay. And you are salaried or self-employed? Salaried. Salaried. What is your current salary right now? It's a coincidentally. I cannot share it with you but it's ... Approximately. You can say between this to this so that I can understand because it should not be less than 10,000. That's why I'm asking. It's much more. Much more. Like 20 to 30? More. 30 to 40? Even a little bit more. Okay. I will consider 40 approximately. Okay. Okay. And how long you are working with the company? How many years? Eight years. Eight years. Wonderful. And may know your age please? 42. 42. Okay. Great. Do you have any other questions? No. Okay. Okay. Okay. Only you have credit card. What is the total limit altogether in the credit card? 15,000. Okay. And may know your nationality please? Jordan. Jordan. Okay. And then what's your total annual credit card? 15,000. And then what is the total credit card? 15,000. Okay. How much does the credit card cost? 15,000. Okay. How much does the credit card cost? 15,000. 15,000. Okay. And mostly the property which you're looking for, it's ready to move in property or off plan? Off plan and ready. Okay. Let me give you some explanation here. Okay. If you're going with ready to move in property, you can get a mortgage value of up to 80% of the property value. 20% you will pay from your hand. I know. I know. Okay. I have this 20 to 30% down. Okay. In case if you're going for off plan property, the property should be completed at least understood. Understood. I know this information. Okay. Okay. Let's say that I will have this ready next year for example, what is the requirement? Okay. Then also. Let's say now. So. No, no, no. Let's say I will buy it now. Ready to move in? What is that? Yes, yes. Okay. If it is ready to move in, then you can get up to 80%. If it is offline, the property should be completed at least 60% or more. Understood. Okay. 60% completion letter. Yes. Minimum it should be because there is an application called Dubai rest. This is from Dubai government. So. So. It is from a different Emirates, not from Dubai. Dubai. If it is different Emirates, no issues. We can get the confirmation letter from the government directly that this property has been completed this much. Then yes, we can proceed further or you can get the letter from the construction, you know, contractor and you can give it to us like 60% is completed based on that the bank will decide how much can be known like either 60% or 70% or 80% based on the construction. Okay. Okay. And the property price, how much will be approximately 2.5 million. 2.5 million. Okay. This is this will be a first property in UAE. Yes. This property. Okay. And we are planning to purchase any specific time frame like after two months or three months. As soon as I find it, as soon as you find it. Okay. These are the information I required as of now. So as per the details which you have given, I can see that you are qualified to go for you know, the loan. But the only thing is about the property off plan or ready to move in as I mentioned before in case if you are looking out for the property off plan, make sure that it is completed at least 60% or more so that it will be more easier to get the loan from the banks. Hello. Hello. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So right now I have taken on all the details. So right now I'll be forwarding this details to one of the mortgage advisors who will be contacting you within 24 to 48 hours time and they will let you know what are the options available.

And then this property, according to the agent, is only one bank that is going to accept it. Only one bank is accepting, which is the bank. And the Bayeutlantic Bank is so fine because they're trying to consider and finally, when they checked my credit card, it's less balanced. They said we cannot do it because... I have lots of credit cards to pay. Okay, Miss, could you please... It's as easy as I'm able to pay it, but they're instantating because of the liability, you know? Yes, yes, I understand, Miss.

So you have already bought the property and you want to do a mortgage against that, right? Yes. Okay. And it's an off plan or it's ready to move in? It's a resort unit. It's a resort unit. Yeah. Resort unit. Yeah. Okay, okay, okay. And you want how much loan you're looking for? 500K? Like how much loan? How much loan? Actually, my balance is only 265. Okay. It's 1.2 million. I got it 1.2 million. I think around 1 million. My balance is 275,000. And I'm going to pay 100,000 this quarter to pay the loan. My balance is only 175,000. Okay, okay, okay. 175, okay. My balance now is 275,000. But I'm going to pay... 125,000. ...this first June. So my balance will be 175,000 only. Okay. And... Okay, ASAP. Okay, when you have tried to another bank, I guess in Kitsi, you had tried to apply another bank as well. Which bank, ma'am? Point NB. Okay, and what they said, what was the reason? Why they have rejected? Layability. I have maximized my credit cards and I have a loan. Okay. No worries. So what I will do is I will send these details to the market advisor. They're going to give you a call, okay? And they will give you the multiple options from the different banks and they can get back to you. No, see the bank that is going to process it is only Dubai Islamic Bank. Only one bank. Okay. Because somebody already tried to process it and they went through different banks. And also the part of Europe advised me that only Dubai Islamic Bank is giving loans for their property. So only Dubai Islamic Bank. And we tried it. It is for self-use or it is for lease? It is for investment. It is for investment? Okay. Yes. Okay, no worries. Let me check the details and I will get back to you on this, okay? We'll give you the exact details what we're going to get it, okay? And did you check your score and everything? Everything is okay? Your bureau score? I think it's about 648. 648, okay. And what is the usage of credit card? In this 240 how much you used? In 450 how much you used? It's like 90, 95 percent. 95 percent you have used it? Yes. Okay, no worries. Okay, no worries. I will just check and we'll get back to you on this, okay? Hello. Yeah, tell me. What do you think is better? A new apartment or a new property or market is already there? The new property always will be better because you're getting, you know like how it looks like. First thing, second thing you can move it. You don't need to wait for the property and for the offline, it takes some time. That is the thing. What happened is I'm paying my apartment is 95,000, 90,000 and then I'm paying service charge and all that. I'm paying a year, like 95,000. You're done. Okay. So I have actually, I'm waiting for this completion of one, two bedroom apartment. I think this will take two years. Okay. I'm supposed to live there. So if there is, you know, like if there is a ready apartment, I'm thinking of getting a new one by mortgage. Is that possible? Because the heart of Europe, I bought it 1.2 million. Okay. 1.2 million and it is paid already around 1 million. I need to pay only 100,000. I'm going to pay by first week 100,000. So my balance will be 175,000. That will be manageable for me. So instead of continuing my rent here, which is 95,000 per year, I'm thinking of just buying a ready unit, you know, by mortgage instead of renting. Yes, you can do that. So you also even get an idea how much you're going to get it. And like me, you know, what's an personality? Hello, Philippine. Yeah. Okay. And what I will do, I will just send this details to the market advisor. Okay. He can give you the multiple options for it. And whatever the interest is going to be there, he can update you on this one. Okay. All right. Now don't apply for any other banks, man. If you're applying for any other bank, your bureau school will go down. Okay. Wait for it. Let the market advisor will give you a call. Okay. But actually, as I told you, this residency only last month. Yes, that is fine. That is fine. If it is rejected, no, but don't worry. We have a tire with the almost 40 into 15 bands. So you don't need to worry about it. We will give you the solution. Okay. And what happened is this property, only one bank can process it. Only one bank, which is the ID. Yes. If there's a DIP also, we have the access in the DIP also. We can try to take the deviation. We can try to get it rejected because of the liability. You know, let's see with the other bank. That's one single CVD other banks as well. We'll buy it. Maybe there could be a chance we can take the deviation and we can apply for it. Okay. You never know. Maybe it can be, can be happened. Okay. Let them give them a chance. Let them give them try if they can do it. They will let you on this. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you for giving it. Have a nice day. Bye bye.\",\n",

Because if it's off plan, let's say you are finding one BHK with like off plan BHK. And if you're willing to proceed with the mortgage, the percentage of construction should be ready at least for 50 or 60. That's not what I'm mortgaging.

       "  'content': {'text': \" Hello. Hello, good morning. Hi, good morning. Am I speaking to Ms. Mariam? Yes. Ms. Mariam, I am Juraro calling you from Pripko Services. How are you doing today? Thank you so much. How are you? I am good. Thank you so much for asking. I have got an inquiry that you are looking for ModGate from Mr. Gan Fernando. Yes, yes. Yeah, you are planning to purchase Vela, but you want ModGate on that, right? Yes. Yes, I am calling you on that. I want to know the condition and also how much is the maximum loan or ModGate that we can take and for giving back that, how much is the profit and how much time does it take? See, I will tell you one thing. You are a resident of Dubai, right? Yes. Yeah. So you will get up to 80%. So you have to arrange, say for example, if you are planning to buy a Vela, you have to do the down payment on your own, whether it's 24% or 20% from the developer, you have to do that on your own. So Bank will give you up to 80% ModGate. Okay. Now, if we compare rates from January to rates in May now, rates are going lesser, like lower, it's fluctuating. Yeah. So it's the best time to go for ModGate because rates are starting from 3.99 onwards earlier, it was before 0.9. Now it's 3.9. Yes. And if you talk about pre-approval, pre-approval you will get within five working days. And then once the pre-approval is with you, it will last for 45 days with you, the validity. Okay. So you have to avail and finalize the property within that period of time so that you can start your ModGate on your property. Okay. Otherwise, if you just cross the 45 days after having the pre-approval, then you have to start the process from zero again. Okay. Okay. And depending upon your age and your choice, for how many years you want to take this ModGate for. So on that basis, the total amount which you are taking and the rate which you are finding suitable for you will be applied on the total amount and will be divided by the months which are coming in those years. And then with that, whatever the amount will come from that side, that will be your monthly EMI for your ModGate on basis of your salary. Okay. You said based on the salary, but my husband is a business owner. That is okay. We just, for the business owner, we have to understand what is the turnover, how long is the business, and what is the minimum balance your husband is maintaining from last six months or three months in the account. Okay. So once we have that information with us, we do for self-employed people as well. Okay. Sure. So I'll ask you some questions if you are going to take it forward right now so that I can have your profile and give it to my ModGate advisor. Is that okay with you? Actually, what we want to do is that we want to know, that's the first time that we want to use ModGate in Dubai. So for sure, we want to know how much can we get from back and based on that, maybe we can go for more expensive, yes, more expensive will ask. Yes. And you will have an idea, like how much amount bank will finance you, and how much you have to put as a down payment. You will have a clear picture at your site. Exactly. But you know, maybe it takes some time or many months for deciding, for choosing, but this is a good idea. Yes, that is your own choice, whether you will go or not. But having an idea is not in hand, right? Yes. Yes. That's what I want to say. Okay. So you are a resident of Dubai and you want to take it on your husband's name, not your name, right? Yes. Or you want to take it jointly? No, no, it's for my husband. Husband, may I know his name, please? Yes, Mehdi M-E-H-D-I-V-I-D, D for Doug. Mehdi. Yes, Mehdi. Mehdi. M-E-H-D-I-V-I-D. No, no, D-I-M-E-H-E-I-D. Yes, Mehdi. Okay. And the family name is R-A-R-A-S-A-S-A-E-I-E-I. R-A-S-I-E. Yes. Okay. May I know his age? Yes, he is 40 years old. 40 years old. Okay. Now that he is self-employed. You have to tell me what is the turnover for monthly and what is the turnover yearly? Oh, yearly and monthly. What salary has put himself on? You know, you know, monthly, because the turnover is high, I don't know, maybe around 700,000, their hands, one million, their hands. Okay. I will put it as up to one million. Do you know, do you have any idea how much balance has been maintained from last six months or three months in your account? Last three months, I think around, if you want to consider monthly, around one million, so maybe it is around two to three million turnover. Okay. All right. And how long does business enjoy? It's two years. Two years. Okay. Any liabilities you have, like a personal loan or credit cards or car loan you have taken? We have a debit card. Debit is okay. That is your own money. I'm saying credit. Yes. No, no, no, no credit cards. No car loan. No, no. No personal loan from any bank. No, no, no. Okay. Perfect. Okay. May I know your nationality, like which passport you hold? Actually, we have two nationalities, Iranian and Dominican. But I think, yes, my husband is now under the Dominican nationality. So I will put it to the Dominican. Yes. Yes. So we spell it D-O-M-E-N-I-C-A-N. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. All right. This is the first property, right? Yes. Okay. And the price range which you're looking for is how much? Well, we were looking for a 2 million to 2.5 million. Okay. 2.2 million, 2.5 million. Okay. All right. Ms. Maryam, you will get a call from mortgage advisor if in case you are with your husband or you want to give your husband's number so that he can have directly word with the mortgage advisor. Actually, the problem is that he's not in Dubai. Oh, okay. All right. Yes. So once you will have a word with mortgage advisor, whatever he asks, if you are able to provide or you have to wait for the husband, please let him know so that he would do the same as for your convenience. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you so much for the all information. Thank you for calling. It was nice talking to you. Have a wonderful day. You too. And goodbye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.\",\n",

Have you inquired for the property? Okay. Do you remember the name of the real estate, the property? No. No. Do you remember the broker's name, whom you were talking to? No. That's the problem. I don't remember exactly. Basically, see, I'll explain you what our company does. So basically, we have tie up with all the banks in UAE and we are linked with the real estate brokers as well. So once you place an inquiry, they give you a guidance that in case if you're looking for mortgage, they pass on your details to us and then we will be coordinating with you and the bank and get you the best offer available in the market. Okay. So what's the name of your company? It's Pripco, P-R-Y-P-C-O, Pripco. And it is a leasing company, right? Yes. We are providing financial assistance. Good. Then what, the someone that told you that I need that was a developer or a broker? No, no, it's a broker. We got your details from broker and we have to check with you the property details and then we will look. And this broker works with? Mofta Al-Shark properties. Mofta Al-Shark? Yeah. I don't recognize that. So no problem. But you're sure? Okay. Tell me what you have. Sure. Okay. So basically, see, I'll be taking down your details like what property you're looking for. You have your already finalized the property or no. And all these details, we will be sending it for evaluation to our mortgage experts. And then they will get in touch with you and the bank and then they will be evaluating the best offer for you. Then they will discuss it with you in case you have. Okay. If you're a leasing company, why a bank would call me? No, we are not leasing company. So we are providing financial assistance. Once you're purchasing a property in UAE, we are providing you mortgage assistance. So we are linked with the bank. Okay. And you do this service for Mofta Al-Shark or for me? No, no. We do service from the bank. So basically, we are having a tie up with the bank in case you go ahead and check with one bank. You know, it's a long process. They take your request. They do the valuation. After five, 10 days, they will come back to you. And you'll get paid from whom? Me, the bank or the Mofta Al-Shark? We have a tie up. We have a contract with the bank itself. We don't charge anything to our clients. We don't have anything to do with the agency. So they just pass on the details of the clients. Those are interested in purchasing the property. Okay. So how we start that? Well, before we start, I would require a few details from your side. Have you already finalized the property you're going to purchase? Yes. Sure. So can I have the details of the property? You're not a resident here in UAE, right? You're a non-resident. No, I'm not. Sure. I'll note down the details. You're based in Kuwait. Are you a Kuwaiti national? No, of course not. Okay. Can I know your nationality then? Egyptian. Just a moment. But you're currently based in Kuwait, right? Yes. Okay. And the property of finalizing, is that a ready to move in property or an off plan? It's an off plan will be available in December next year, like December 2024. December 2024. Okay. Can I just place you on line for a second, because I have to check if, you know, and what is the percentage of the project completion? Is it more than 50% completed? It is less than 30%. Less than 30%. 36%. 36%. Okay. In that case, because I will have to check, there are certain conditions, off plan properties should be completed at least 50% to 80%. So can I just place you on hold for 10 seconds? Actually, I don't know that. It's for non-resident. It should be at least 100%. No, it's 18%. It can be for an Emirati off plan, but it's never off plan for a non-resident. Never. So tell me, how come you're assisting every now and then this type of service and you don't know that we are not eligible to have mortgage on an off plan property? How come? See, we can give you a mortgage on off plan property only if the property is constructed 80%. That's the reason I asked you. No, no, actually, no. It needs to be 100% and I'm quite sure what I'm saying. That's why I'm surprised a little bit. No, I was surprised a lot. Maybe you have heard about it, but also we are also giving such service on 80%. So that's why I'm pretty much sure. Okay. I wish that, but I'm not going to lie on myself. I know that it can never happen. So if it can never happen, why you say that? Actually, sir, as far as my information is there, like I have already checked it with my superiors. That's the reason we are asking for the person T. So at times it depends on project to project. So maybe the developers you are dealing with maybe they are asking for 100%. And we have, you know, developers here in UAE. Those are also considering at 80%. Okay. So it's going to be like 80% on exactly July next year. I mean in one year. July 2024, right? Yeah, definitely. That's the reason we stopped, you know, I stopped you in between that. Let me double check on this because if it's 36% and if we are not eligible then I will just inform you before you give me further details about this. Okay. Let me have that option. If even if I assume that we are 80% already, so what else I should start with? Yeah, so if it is 80% if you're looking for a property which is off plan and 80% completed, then I would require the value of the mortgage because the mortgage will only be 50% and 50% has to be paid upfront by the client. Okay, sure. That's what's happening already. Perfect. So can I have the total value of the property? Total value is 200, 2,400. 2.4 million. And is this your first mortgage or first property in UAE or do you have an ongoing or active project? Definitely. Which is the first one. Definitely. It will be the first mortgage in UAE. First mortgage in UAE, perfect. And one moment. Can I have the project name as well of what is the property or the project? Azizi Azur. In Miran, Muhammad bin Ratchitsej. Azizi Azur, which is AZO UR. AZURE. URE, okay. And this is in Medan. Yeah. Okay, perfect. And just give me one moment. You're working there in Kuwait? Are you like salaried or you own a company in Kuwait? You're working. No, I have a salary of about 56 plus thousand. URE. URE. No, of course. Yeah, UAE 80. Just give me one second. Okay. And you're working for this company for how long? For how many years now? For more than three years. More than three years. I mentioned you're like 3.5. 3.5 what? Like as in three years and about four, five months. Is that okay? Yeah, okay. 3.5. Sure. Just give me one second. I believe I've got all the details so far and yeah, it's good to go. So I'll do one thing. I'll share all the details with one of our mortgage experts. They will be coordinating with you and the bank and they will get you, you know, once the valuation and everything is done, they will share with you the offer from the bank. It will be a better offer. From your common experience, which bank would offer mortgage for an 80% property? Yeah, I will definitely check that for you. So because it depends, there are certain banks giving on 60 to 70% as well. So 80% as well. We know that we know clients are getting it on 80%. It's good that it's almost 100% completed. Then we might get a better offer, but then on 80% also certain banks are catering our, you know, us offers. And what's the current interest rate? So it ranges between 4.5% to 5.2%. It varies depending on the customer's profile. The project are, you know, based on customer's profile. So based on your salary, I can assume that we will get a good offer. Thank you. One more thing. How I can as an on resident expect whatever I'm not resident and not the emirati, not national citizen. So how can I ever have a bank account like current account to start putting checks, accepting checks and start the process? Okay, see we have an option here with banks where you can come and physically open a bank account for non-residents. So for that you have to be there in the country to open a bank account. And you have to walk in in the branch and, you know, ask them to open an account. They will be verifying your passport because that's the only ID we have as a non-resident. You don't have an emirati ID since you're not a resident here. So you will have to be physically present in the country and open a bank account and then they will be issuing you the debit card or the checkbook accordingly. That's easy. It's an easy process. It's not really tough. I mean, it's not a, it's a has to see process. No requirements, no qualifications. No qualifications at all. I go for them, please, I want to, I'm coming here for tourism and I just want to open a bank account. No minimum charges, no minimum deposit. There will be minimum charges because as per UAE bank's policy, all the banks, they have a minimum charge. So you will have to keep a minimum balance accordingly. Like you have to maintain certain minimum balance. It depends. So can I add one more task or say that to connect with the bank that would do this for me? I can be in UAE Dubai specifically in a week or by the beginning of the next month. If this is doable, I can go process this because I need that. I would suggest you to first wait for the offer. Once the offer comes, then I think it's best because account opening is not an issue. You can do it, you know, in one day. But if you offer... This what can I have now because 80% needs one year, you know. So I know that even if you have a good news for me, it will be not applicable before one year. And meanwhile, I need to transfer some deposits and I do this from exchange market and from my colleagues bank accounts. And that's annoying. So if I have my own bank account whenever I have liquid money, I transfer them there. It will be better, way better. So I will check for the account opening also along with the mortgage approval. So we will keep you updated for that. And also once you're having a conversation with the mortgage export, you can double check with him as well. What is the best possible way to open an account? Maybe he will suggest you something better because they're the ones dealing directly with the bank. We are just the coordinators between you and them. So once he's calling you, once he's contacting you. Actually, you give me two brand new information today that I have never knew about before. And I've been searching this issue for five months and I talked about 59% about this issue. Yeah, like brokers and financial consultants and people like that. So I talked to many of them and most of them were... So actually for non-residents, what they do is normally when you... I mean, have you ever tried walking into a bank's branch directly? No, but I online shared with an ADCP officer. And he assured that you have, for example, to deposit 200,000 AEDs that should not be touched. And that's the only way for his bank, ADCP. Okay. Once you're on your... I would suggest... Some people say that if you make a minimum deposit of 25,000, it will be sufficient in some other banks. And you mentioned nothing about both, so I was surprised. Right. See, it depends. See, once you're opening an account and you're not a resident, you will definitely keep certain amount. If you're not keeping any amount, then you will be charged for 25 dirhams per month. That's a penalty for all the bank accounts anyway. That's it. 25 dirhams per month. Yes. But the account is not... So I come just with my passport ID and that's it. That's it. Once your account is open, then it's up to you if you would like to transfer the amount. No bank statement, no recommendation letter, no certificate of salary. In case if they ask you at that point in time also, you can just show the bank statement from the online banking. That's absolutely fine. That's great. Okay. Yeah. So I know you could recommend a bank that applies for these requirements, for these simple requirements. Yes. So if you recommend one bank that you are sure this bank can accept this, in this way you are discussed with me, so please share it with me. Sure. Let me go ahead and share this for you. I have the same number, so whenever you can reach any information in any direction about the mortgage or about the bank that I'm offering this, please share it with me. Sure. I'll do that, sir. I'll give it a check and then once I have the final information, I'll give you a call back. No worries. Thank you very much. Okay. Then he will be calling you back in the next 48 hours. I would just appreciate if you can take the call. He will call you on the same number, yeah? Okay, sure. Thank you, Mr. Eman. Yeah. The one who will call me is... He's the mortgage expert. A name I would not be able to confirm you now because there's a department before what the request there and then one of the persons will be calling you back. Okay. Can I write down your name again? Sure, sure. My name is Naila. Naila. Naila. Naila. It's N-A-R-L-A. Naila. Yeah. Naila, this is an Arabic name? Yes, it is an Arabic name. Exactly. I was actually born here in UAE. That's why my parents selected an Arabic name for me. And why you didn't talk in Arabic? It's your whole time... For lunchtime in... I studied Arabic. But... Yeah, I studied Arabic. But when it comes to talking, I understand when people are talking but I cannot talk in Arabic. Great. Nationality, if you may. I'm from Pakistan. Welcome. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. It was nice talking to you. I hope I was able to answer all your queries. If you have any more questions, just list them down and the guy will answer you, the other person who would call you again. Sounds great. Thank you very much. You're welcome, Ehmans. Thank you. Would you drop just a WhatsApp message? Sure. I'll drop you a message on this number. Yeah, the one who requested this for me might I contact him back, please? Definitely. I'll drop you a message on WhatsApp and I'll also update you, the person who will be giving you a call once he's assigned. Thank you very much. Welcome. Take care. Goodbye. Bye.\",\n",

       "  'content': {'text': \" Hello. Hello, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Am I speaking to Mr. Fawad? Yes. Mr. Fawad, this is Hadid. I'm calling you from Perfco Services. I see you're inquiring that you're looking for property mortgage. Yes, I want to remortage. I have a DID mortgage on my property in Maidan and in Millennium States. The current balance is about 3.4 million pounds. I've been very regular in my payments from beginning, no issues since 2016. 223 months are remaining. Suddenly the interest rates have gone up. So from what I was paying about 18,000 or 19,000, now it's about 30,000 pounds, which is too much. So I just wanted to see if there is any fixed products available that I could transfer the DID to other banks with three-year fixed, etc. What's the percentage of the rate for now? I don't know what's currently what was before the mortgage. As I said, right now, it's three, the outstanding balance is 3.39 million pounds. 223 months are remaining. So I've paid for like maybe seven years or six years and 19 years are left. I don't know. It's gone up. I think overall, all in all, it would be around 5.5-6%. It's not more because you know how the current mortgage rate was also... What was the first mortgage that you took, the initial amount? The initial amount was 4.05 of 4.2 million dirhams. 4.2, okay. I have the whole schedule for the DID because I just recently got a golden visa, so they have sent me the whole mortgage profile. So for now, I need to ask you a few questions. Which bank you're dealing with now? DIB. Okay. I think the rate for now is 6.80, if I'm not wrong. Yeah, something around those lines. It must be here. Yeah. And your residence here since when? 2010. Okay. And may I know your age? 46. Now you took the mortgage for 25 years, yeah? Correct. Good. Are you an employee or a... Okay. And the main or your salary? It's 115,000 dirhams a month. Eight?

And previously, where you used to work? I used to work for a company called Holkin Investments. I was there for more than two years. Holkin. Holkin Investments in the IFC. And now where you're working? I'm working for a company called Terminus International. Terminus. Terminus, P-E-R-M-I-N-U-S. Yeah. Terminus and Termational. Okay. Good. For how long you've been working with this previous company? Previous company two years. Two years. And the salary was almost the same? Yes, the salary structure was different there because it was high on the sort of bonus and commissions. And now this is more fixed. It's pretty much equates to the same, but yeah. Okay. Because there is like last six months backstage. And so as you're working with the current company for less than four months, they did extra journals, which we get it from previous companies earlier. And I may know if you have any liabilities like personal loan, car loan or other. Up till now, no car loan, no personal loan. I've got credit cards. Okay. What's the limit? So my HSBC, so I've got three credit cards. Okay. HSBC, MSNBD and MDIT. What is the total value? I have to check. I think MSNBD has the biggest credit limit for me. It's 285,000. Okay. Hello? Your voice is breaking. I can't hear you. But about now, am I audible? Yes, now I can hear you. Good. I'm asking you like approximately the total value is like 300,000? 350,000 more likely. Yeah. 350,000. Okay. Okay. May I know your nationality? British. British. And yeah. The property is the idea for sure. No, I've been living here for the past. I'm using it for my personal users. Okay. Good. Now, for now, I have like enough information. Just I will need to forward it to the mortgage advisor. They will be in touch with you as soon as possible. I believe by today they will contact you. Okay. It's not tomorrow. Yeah. I think better to ask, call me tomorrow. Because now I'll be going into a meeting and I'll be very busy till quite late. So if they can call me tomorrow. But find out what's the best rate they can offer. I know, first Abu Dhabi Bank is offering me 3.93 or something fixed and MSNPD also something similar. Because you guys are professional, I'm sure. So find out what sort of things can be done. The value of the property is more than 10 million dirhams. Okay. So LTV is going to be very low. 3.34 is very low LTV. And what else is, so the idea is if I could get to better sort of a low instructor pricing etc. That's what I'm asking. Okay. No problem. We'll try to like provide you with the best service ever. And we will give you options for sure. So you can choose which one we work with. And how do you guys get paid?

I have received an inquiry that you are interested in taking ModGage. Is that correct? Is taking what? ModGage. Property ModGage. Yes. Okay. All right. On purpose of that, I just quickly wanted to know... One second. One second. Yes. Sorry. Yes. Can you hear me? You are saying? Yeah. The property which you are planning to buy, is it already finalized or you are still looking in the market? Yeah. Almost finalized. Almost finalized. Okay. All right. I just have to have your profile. I will ask you a few questions. Is that okay? Yeah. It depends. I don't understand how you get my name. It has been as a freelancer over here. I cannot give you the name but it is on my portal right now. The questions are very general. Nothing much in it. I have only had a pre-approval from MRS MBD. Okay. All right. We worked with almost 14 banks in Dubai. Okay. So what happens is we do give pre-approval as well but according to the choice of yours and give you a lot of, you know, choices from which bank you want to go with because every bank has a different rate. Every bank has different fixed rates for five years or two years and so that our client will have an idea which bank is preferred for them. So that is the reason we give pre-approval and if you have already got it from MRS MBD, you can check it from our side as well and other banks as well like Maastricht, DIB, Ambrose Islamic and... The most important thing for me is the national loan amounts because I am what I receive now is lower than I expected. So that is what I would like to have. How much is the property value? The property value itself is 6 million. 6 million? Yeah. Okay. All right. And you are aware that a bank can give you up to 80% based on your profile. What level is your credit? 70, right? Yeah. 80, 80, 80%. Okay. Yes. 80%. What level do you have like credit cards? Yeah. So I want that. I am closing everything. So it will be zero. So no personal loan, no car loan, no credit cards? No. No, I am closing everything. Okay. So I will put it as zero. Then it's fine. You will get up to exactly 80%. So I know how old are you? 40. 40. Perfect. Are you a salary or self-employed? Salary. Perfect. May I know how much is the salary? 58,000. 58, I am not wrong. 5, 8, right? Yeah. Okay. All right. How long have you been working with the current company? Almost two years. Two years. Perfect. Okay. May I know which passport you hold? Netherlands. Dutch. Sorry? Netherlands. Dutch. Netherlands. Okay. Dutch. Okay. So, and the whole thing is about bonus. So I have, I will explain to you. So I have one full year bonus and one bonus of several and a half months. That's an additional income. Yeah. That's a certain amount, right? Yeah. That is okay. That's fine. Your salary is almost fine. And when your documents will be taken like your pay sales or your bank statement, that will be automatically depicted there. Yeah. I want to, I want to, okay, before I go on to some old documents, because I already did it, I want to have a copy of your site. Yeah. Pre-calculation. Okay. What's more or less the money I can get. Yes. Yes. My mod advisor, my mod advisor will give you exact calculation of what and which rate is suitable for you and which bank can give you what rate. He will talk to you about everything and then he will take it forward according to your. And do you have a pay you a fee for this or just? No, no, no. It's completely free. Completely free. We have upper-owned tie-ups with bank. For you, there is no charge. No charge. I'm saying it on a recorded line. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So the important thing here is, and I will explain to you, I will say to you how much it is. The most important thing is the bonus, two years bonus. Yeah. So shall I tell you what I receive? You want to know that? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I did, I have written as your salary like this. Once my mortgage advisor will give you a call and then you can explain them. This is my additional income. I will put it as a 58K plus additional income. And what number is it? You will explain them and show the documents. Then only it will make sense to bank, right? Okay. Yeah. Okay. I will put as an additional income over here. Okay. All right. So it's the first property in UAE, right? Yeah. Okay. All right. That's pretty much it. These were the pre-qualification questions.

I'm fine. From what company? Sorry? Kutku Services. We do services related to the state. I have received an inquiry for ModGage. Yes, correct. Yeah. I have to ask you a few questions so that I can have your process. Yes, sure. Are you a resident of Dubai or not? No, no. You're a non-resident. May I know how old are you? 42. 42. Okay. What is the source of income you have there? Are you a salary or a salary? I'm working. I'm living apart in a company, like a big company in Austria. I get an employed salary, a regular salary, but 14 times a year. How much does this monthly? 2500 euros. 2500 euros? Yes, it's 3900 before taxes. Yeah, then you pay the tax and this is what remains in your account, right? Exactly, yes. Okay, how long have you been working with this company? Six or seven years since 2016. Okay. It's mentioned on the television. Yeah. Okay, any liabilities you have like credit cards, personal loan or car loan you have taken there? No, no loans. No loans. No loans. No credit cards. No, I just have some apartments, some renting too. That is your additional income, yes? Exactly, yes. But I don't know if you need that too. No, I just have to ask you one thing. What is the balance you are maintaining from past six months in your account? My balance? Which is untouchable. I don't understand this question. I'll tell you. You mean the liquidity of money? Into euro, yeah, I'll tell you. You'll understand. Yes, so what I am saying is if we check your last six months balance, okay, are you maintaining 6000 euros every month? Maintaining means like getting? No, not getting. Maintaining as in which you do not touch. If say for example... Oh no, I have one account with over 60,000 euros. I have one account with 100,000 euros. Perfect, perfect. That's what it's maintained continuously from last six months, right? If we check the back state. Oh yes, yes, yes. It's like even saving accounts, I can use it any time. Exactly, at the same time you have money there, yeah? It keeps the schedule there since many years. I got it, I got it. Now, do you know which passport you hold? I mean your nationality? Austria. Austria, okay. Not Australia, it's Austria. Austria, Austria, I know, yeah. So the property which you are planning to buy in UAE, this is ready to move in unit, right? Yes, it's the ready unit and I was talking with your colleague, I don't know the agent, and there is an apartment for 1.75 million. 1.75 million. Which is a little bit too high for me because I don't want to spend much liquid money. Yeah. Yes, because all properties are in Egypt, so I don't really want to spend my money, you know? I always try to spend, or how you call it, to invest and get the rental money to pay out. And in Egypt you don't have mortgages, you have payment funds. Yeah, over here you have a choice, see for example, as a non-resident you have to pay 50% of the amount. Say for example, 1.75 is the total amount of the property, half of this has to be paid from your side towards the property. 50%. Yes, and up to 50%, you will get from the bank as a non-resident. Yes. So whatever the amount you are taking. Of course, everybody told me 40%. Yeah, up to 50%. See, you know how it happens, we say the correct figure is up to 50%. Up to as in we use it, it can be 45%, it can be 47%, based on your profile, your income profile. Yeah, on that basis bank will give you up to 50%. So whatever the amount you are taking for the property, like say for example, 1 million, 500,000 has to be paid from your side. Yeah, say for example, 700,000, 350,000 has to be paid from your side. Whatever the amount you are taking in total for the property, half has to be paid from your side. As a down payment, yeah. And this is going to be the first property in Dubai, right? Yes. Okay, all right. I will take forward your case, mortgage advisor will give you a call, they will ask for certain documents, and then they will get a pre-approval for you. Once you have a pre-approval in hand, you will have a clear picture, how much bank is going to give you, and which, you know, price range is suitable for you to go for. Okay, perfect. Yeah, okay, that's good. Okay, all right. Thank you, have a lot. And how long this approval will? Pre-approval will not take much time, the moment you will give us the document, it will take 5 to 7 writing days to come in. No, no, I mean when I get the approval, do I have to get the... Do you get the property in the same week, or can I get it in the company? No, no, no, no, you have 45 days to avail that. Okay, perfect, that's good. Okay, all right. Thank you so much. Thank you, have a lovely day. You too, bye. Bye.\",\n",

We actually got the details from the real estate broker. The mortgage assistance. Yes, yes, sure. Sure. So the reason for me to call you is to understand your profile and I can have one of a mortgage advisor call you tomorrow by checking with all the banks and the offers that are going on. Okay, so if you can let me know like have you already finalized the property or you're yet to finalize. No, no, no, in fact, because you know, I will be trying to assess the budget and I told that you know, I will need to take a mortgage. So I want to know how much mortgage I can take etc. Okay, I got it. So depending upon the value you will be deciding which property you would go with right. Right. All right. So may I know your profile like how old are you? I'm 41. And currently you're working in Dubai or you're a self-employed? I've been working in Dubai for the last nine years. From nine years. So in the same company you're working since how long? Nine years. Nine years. Okay. And may I know how much is your salary? Are you two? And do you have active mortgage or personal loan or auto loan at the moment? No, nothing. Nothing at all. How about credit cards? I have a couple of those. And may I know the total amount like the limit of it? Yeah, I'm just asking you earlier as well because you know, that is substantial. I think I should be around 2000 or something more than that. I think. Okay. Because I don't use one of them. I don't use one of them. And I think what I found out recently is that it does not really help when you're taking mortgage. Right. Exactly. What happens is some of the banks like CBD or other banks, they will calculate it as 2% as a liability for you. Okay. Or some other banks might take it as 5%. So normally what the mortgage advisor would do is they will compare with credit card, how much is the amount of value that you can get for the property, like the loan and without a credit card. For example, if you're not using them or if you close them, then how much will be the value that you will be receiving from the bank? I think we have 3K company, the city bank, ADCB, FAB and MUSTVC and 4 credit cards. Okay. So what we said between around 200,000, yeah, around 200,000. Around 200,000. 300, 300, 300. 300. Okay, 300,000. All right. And you are originally from which country? India. And you are in the UA since how long? Nine years. Nine years. Okay. Thank you so much for all the information that you have provided. So do you want me to arrange a call back tomorrow by the same time or in the morning it's okay with you? Tomorrow this time is okay. Okay. So one of our mortgage advisor will look into your profile and they will directly call you and start guiding you as to what documents and what bank types. Any press fair will bank that you are looking at at the moment? No, I mean, my salary is out of the ADCB but that is nothing meaning that I would want to go with them. I know the interest rates are really high right now across everywhere. So I am trying to go with the one which is the lowest, yeah? The lowest one. Okay. All right. Not an issue then. So tomorrow mortgage advisor will call you at the same time. Okay. All right. Thank you so much for your time.\",\n",

So thanks for asking. Sir, I believe you're in an inquiry to cast the mortgage. Are you looking for a mortgage services? How did you get my contact information? Just give me one. I will just tell you to name the person. Sure. Is this the company that is established by the daughter of the Demac CEO? For who? Who is the CEO for your company? It's Amira Sajwani. She's the daughter of the Demac guy, right? Yes. The Demac guy. Fidelity premium? Hello? Yes, hello. Fidelity premium has given me your number, sir. Fidelity premium. What's the name of the person? Passer's name is not there. Only Fidelity premium. Agency name only is there, sir. I'm very sorry for that. Interesting. Fidelity premium. Okay, fine. I'm just asking because a couple of days ago an agent actually mentioned that your company and he sent me the name by WhatsApp but I never authorized to start sharing my number and so I need to track it obviously. But tell me about your process basically. So, essentially, you have special rates. At this point, the interest rates right now are crazy. Do you have any? Yes. The interest rate which we are providing is 3.99 to 5.99. Again, it depends on your company, your score and your salary. Okay, cool. Score is good. I work with Central Bank. Yes. So, we're the source of the rates. Wow. You are the first person I've met to work with Central Bank. Yes, I'm very glad you're here, sir. Pleasure to meet you as well. So, basically, the amount of the properties is 3.3. Yes, you can share with me some details. I just need some few details, sir, if you don't mind. May I know what's the age? 39. 39. Okay. May I know how much your salary, if you don't mind? Can we do that? Yes, it's something we have to provide better. So, it's 46. 46. Okay. And since how long you're working in the same company? So, this one is less than a year but the one previously was more than six months. Prior to that, I was with the consultancy company for about 12 years straight. And do you have any credit cards, personal loan, auto loan? Personal loan. Card loan I have with an outstanding balance of 29. How much you pay monthly every month? 3000. So, nine more installments, it would be over. And I can pay it off just needed as well if it helps since like 2029. And do you have any personal loan? No. No. Okay. No credit cards? I do with HSBC. It's a limit of 59. Only one card? Only one card, yeah. 29. Okay. And may I know your personality? Jordanian. Jordanian. Okay. And you're looking for ready to move in or looking for off plan? Be off plan at this stage. Off plan. The off plan is more than 50% or less than that sir? The concept is? Yeah, not more. More than that. Yeah. I'm looking for something that could be ended over in the next six months. Six months. Does that make a difference by the way for the application? The thing is that I will tell you sir, we can only give the mortgage where the construction has been done more than 50% like 50 to 60% sir. To see that the rest of the public. Because there are yeah, because there are only few banks which we are giving on the off plan. And what I can suggest to you because if you're going for the off plan, they will give you the highest interest. So it's better if you're going for ready to move in. And you know when the property is ready, right? You can directly go and you can live there. So I can write both? Yeah. And let's see the difference. But the specific property I'm looking at, they're supposed to be handled over in either July or in August. So it's completely ready. The evaluation is done as well and all these things. Okay. And how much loan you're looking for? So the amount of the property. Just give me a minute. Yeah. So the amount of the property itself is 3.3. 3.3. Yeah. And essentially I want to go with the ratio of I will pay 63%. Oh, nice. Okay. And some mortgage 37%. 37% 3.3. And he needs. 1221 I think maybe that's. Yeah. I assume 1.2 because essentially what I'm trying to do is get them to this point. That's 1.2. Okay. And when you're planning to buy a property. So I need the hand over. Yes. Yes. Honestly, I'll tell you what, it depends on the rate I'm getting. Because yeah, we're supposed to have a time to get them on here. But this property would be handed over to August. This is the target. So the next three months. Next three months, then we can try for it for them. If it is the next three months, yes, we can try first. Okay. And this will be a first property in UAE, right? No, I already have one actually. You already have one. This is going to be a second property. I'm going to sell the other one basically. But this is the idea that is. In the current status, it's under your name, right? Yeah, yeah. And it's fully paid off as well. Yeah. Oh, that's very nice. Okay. So what I will do, I will just send this details to the market advisor. Okay. The market advisor will give you a call and he will tell you the extraction to straight from all the banks.

So, once you have that profile, once you have that pre-approval in your hand, you will have an idea which property you should go for because whatever the price range you are looking for, you have to pay 20% according to the final amount you are choosing. 20% has to be down payment for your side because for the residents banks only provide up to 80% mortgage. So, you will have a clear picture like how much bank is going to finance and how much you should be giving as a 20% and which property you should go for. And after getting pre-approval, you have 45 days to finalise the property. Exactly. Okay, okay. And you can assist in getting first pre-approval. Yes, I can assist you in that, yes. And you will have that paper with you and later when you finalise the property, you can simply avail it, start your mortgage. Okay, so, with this regard, you have any some chapters? I just have to ask you a few questions which is very general like your age and your source of income. That's it. And then I will forward it to my mortgage advisor. They will ask for the documents and take your case forward to the bank. No, no, but the 30 before doing that one, you are in charge of the company. No, no, no, there is no charge. It's completely free. You won't be charged anything from our side. Okay. Okay. So, let's go ahead with questions. Yes. Okay, all right. You are a resident of the bank. How did you get my number? We have received it from Reign Rail Estate. Okay, one hand that is in Dubai, yes, yes, yes. Okay. Okay, yeah. So, you are a resident of Dubai, right? I mean, UAE, right? Yeah. Okay. May I know how old are you? 41. 41. Okay. Are you salaried or self employed? Salaried. Salaried. May I know how much is a salary? 41,000 per month. 31, right? 41, yeah. 41. 41. Okay. All right. How long you've been working with this company? Eight years. Eight years. Any liabilities you have? I mean credit cards, card loan, personal loan? Definitely credit cards. How many, how much limit you have taken and how many credit cards you have? Putting five credit cards. Five credit cards. Can you just roughly tell me to limit how much limit you have taken? These are here, higher side limits. So, one card is 50,000, another card is 15,000, then two cards are done, another two cards are done. Let's say roughly 100K? No, it will be more than that. More than that? You are asking credit card limit, right? Yes, yes, yes, limit. Okay, because two credit cards bank themselves, they increase their credit limit. Oh, okay. I will put it as more than 100K. Correct. Okay. May I know which passports you hold? I mean your nationality? Indian. Indian. Okay.

Is this going to be the first property in UAE? Yes. Okay, all right. That's pretty much it. I will share your details with my mortgage advisor. He will ask you for the documents and give you a call shortly and give you the best possible rate from different banks. And if there is any preferred bank you want to go with, they can do that for you even. And then you will have a pre-approval and can finalize the property after that. Yeah. Yeah, one missing information is I don't have any other loan liability. Yeah, I put it as like there is no liability and you just have credit cuts which are limit is this. That's it. Yeah. Okay.

Ms. Amin, we've got your reference from one of our channel partners. My name is Rohan. I'm calling from Kripco. Yes. And your details are given to us by a channel partner for mortgage assistance. Are you looking to take a property and you need a bank loan for it? Yes, that's true. Okay, I just need to understand a few details. Okay. The property, is it off plan? Well, no, I've not selected a property yet. I'm still looking. Okay. I'm in the process of, I'm not finalizing one yet. I'm just trying to work out, you know, what my budget is and then I can see forward. I've been told it needs to be under 800K. Okay, that's your budget or that is the maximum that you're looking at? That's the maximum mortgage I can take. Okay. I'm going to be, yeah. Will you be comfortable paying the 20% down payment? Yeah, yeah. Okay. And is this going to be your first property in the UA? Yeah, yeah. Okay. And are you looking at ready to move in apartments or are you looking at off plan under construction? Well, I don't mind either way, but they need to be ready before, so I'm looking to move in by the 1st of November of this year. So, 23. Okay. So, I need, even if it is off plan, it needs to be ready for me to move in by November. So, I'm flexible. Okay. I understand. The reason I'm asking, because mostly mortgage can be done only when the property is more than 80% construction done. Oh, okay. Fine. So, because off plan, the bank does not get the option of getting the valuation done. Because it's under construction, they cannot do a valuation. They don't approve the mortgage easily. Okay, fine. So, it's a recommendation that if you're buying the property, try to look for something which is near completion or ready to move in. Yeah, yeah. I mean, the properties that I've been viewing anyway, they're around that they're either ready or near completion. Okay. And can I know which country passport you're on? UK. And can I know your age? I'm 25. Okay. And how long have you been UA resident? Two years. Two years. And are you salaried over here or self-employed? No, I get a salary every month. Salary. Can I know how much is a salary? Yeah, 12,000. Okay. And do you have personal loan or car loan with any of the banks? No, I just have a small loan that's about 30,000 and I pay like 1,300 every month. Is that a personal loan or from the credit card you've taken quick cash? No, I don't have a credit card. It's just a personal loan. Okay. And you're paying almost 1,300 per month? Yeah, yeah. Okay. And are you buying the property alone or do you have a co-applicant? No, it will be under my name, but my mom, she was based in the UK. She will be helping me fund this as well. Okay. I did ask about whether we can get her salary into consideration, maybe increase the loan amount, but I don't think that's possible because she's not a resident in the UAE, right? That's correct because for a resident, the eligibility criteria is different. Non-resident can also do it, but these are two different segments and merging them is not possible. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Yeah, so just be under me, but the money will be coming mostly from my mom. No problem. I've got the primary details which is required for the pre-screening. Have you already applied with any of the banks? No, but I'm in process with one of them, but I've not completed it yet. What is the best bank to go with? Everyone keeps paying you to buy Islamic banks? I was just going to tell you, we work with all the major banks in the UAE. We have contracts in place with them. We don't charge you anything because we work for the banks. Okay, fine. You're right. Dubai Islamic Bank has the best offers possible for mortgage. However, CBD is also a very good bank when it comes to taking mortgage. So what we will do is we will check your profile with the banks that we work with. We'll see which bank is giving you the best offer and we'll give you the offer. Sure. Yeah, yeah, that's really good. Yeah, yeah, let's do that. I appreciate that. I will get a call and then after we check the bank's offer for you and then we'll coordinate accordingly, then you can decide on this. Sounds good. Yeah, everyone. All right, so you'll get to your from my office. My company name is Privko. Okay, fine. And who gave you my details? Who was it again? Just one second. I will have to check in the system one second. It's one of our channel partner, but I will let you know. Yeah. Okay, this is coming from Dave Singla. Dave Singla. Yeah, yeah, good, good. Yeah, good, yeah. So we work with a lot of brokers as well as freelance agents in UAE and we also work with banks. So we'll help you out with this. We'll give you a counter offer before end of day today. Okay. Yeah, sounds good. Okay. Thank you for something. Have a good day. Thank you.\",\n",

       "  'content': {'text': \" Hello. Hello good morning ma'am. This is Sunder calling from Pripo Services ma'am. How are you? I am good. How are you? Sorry to answer. I was in just back to back meeting. And then when I got here I think you guys had closed down. Yeah, correct. No way. I wonder what are the rates that you have right now in terms of the bank? Okay. What is the best rate that you have? We had tied with the multiple banks. Okay. And the rates are getting started 3.99 to 5.99. Okay. And what is the 3.991? Okay. 3.99 to 5.99. Okay. And we had tied with the multiple banks. Like all the banks we have tied with. No, because I am asking you what is the 3.99 rate? Interest rate. Interest rate. No, no. That I know. But is it fixed? And if it is fixed for how many years? What is the variable? Okay. It depends like up to your DBR. It depends up to your score. Like you can say 5 years, 6 years. It depends from how long you want. Like once they will get the pre-approval then only we can say you since how long you can get it. No, no. But I need to know if I get the pre-approval and then they close it at 5 then I do not want that. No, that is no point. When I am anyway getting 4.99. No, no. I will tell you ma'am. We had tied with the multiple banks. So we will tell you from which bank you can get which interest rate. Okay. So that is why I am asking you. So what is the lowest interest rate that I have? It is 3.99. 3.99. This is fixed for how many years? It is fixed for how many years that I have to check. Just give me a moment. Please can you check? Yeah, I will check. Just wait with me. Okay. It is 3.99. It is fixed for one year. That is very little right? And then after that what is the variable rate you are seeing? It depends up to like once you get the pre-approval then only we can tell you because it is very little. One year is very little. What is the minimum you have for three years? Again ma'am, it is various. We cannot tell you on the same time. Cannot tell. I do not know. Okay. We cannot. It is very, it is 3.99 between 5.99. So for fixed it will be between 3.99 because see I am already getting rate of 4.8 from standard started. Only and then not. 4.8 from standard started. Yes. And I am getting another 4.24 from back. If I am already getting that then there is no point. Then I will just go to the bank. Okay. If I am getting the information. Okay. For it improved ma'am. Just give me the information. Okay. Let the market advisor will give you a call. Okay. Yeah. And you will got to know from all the banks. You are not telling me to apply for it. Okay. Let us give me the details. Let them come back to you and give you the details. If you like it go ahead. If you do not like then you can just tell them. That makes complete sense. Okay. Fine. Okay. So what do you want from me? Okay. I just need some basic details. Okay. Are you resident in your non-resident? Yes. Yes resident. Residents. Okay. May I know what is your age? 39. 39. Okay. Are you self-employed or like you have like you work here somewhere. Salary. Salary. Okay. May I know like how much your salary? 26000 is 28 plus I get bonus and then 4. How much you getting in your account every month? 28. Sorry? 28000. 28000. Okay. And since how long you working in the same company? So the same company is three years but I was earlier a consultant. So I have changed the payroll. As a consultant the payroll is different and now I am more than payroll of the company. So. Oh that's good. I was an epislot consultant. I was a consultant to epislot but now I am hired by epislot. Oh. So if you see my case clip it will change. And epislot internal hire has been since November. Okay. And like how many credit cards do you have? One. One. Okay. And do you have any kind of a personal loan, auto loan? Nothing. Any loan? No. Nothing. May I know your nationality? Yes. Okay. And you are looking for off plan or ready to move in? See off plan I don't think I will get mortgage right? Or do you get mortgage on off plan plans? I don't. We give off plan as well but the construction should be done more than 50 percent. Oh then that's not bad. Then it's better to think on that. Can I try for both and see because I didn't. Yeah that will be what I can say as well. So I think for one which is less than 50 percent completed at least then I will get more return. Okay. Let's see both. Let's see both. Let's see both. Yeah. Because I am not taking it for living. I mean it is taking it for return. So like how much loan you are looking for? So I was thinking about so I have to say 1 million but I think I will use only up to 800,000 because I don't want to invest more than a million on the property. We can say 800 to 1 million? Yes. Yes. We can say that. Okay. This is going to be your first property in U.E.? Yes. Okay. And when you are planning to buy a property? Once I get the pre-approval I don't know how long does the pre-depress. If I like something I will pick it up. No. If I don't know I can't. Once you get the pre-approval ma'am if you agree on that pre-approval you will only having to 35 to 40 days. Okay. That's it? Yeah. That's nothing. How can you? If you like it. It's applicable from all demands. Okay. Because this standard charter it is 60 to 90 days. You are telling me something. 60 to 90 days. Standard charter is an international bank. We are the local bank. So they have a different they have their own rules. And if you going if and I'm sure standard chartered what they always give the higher rate. If you can see the credit card. I saw the other banks. I saw I tell you which ones I saw. I saw of course HSEC is also higher but I saw Rack Bank. Rack Bank was higher. Rack Bank is very higher. Yeah. And the guy was interesting take from us. I said no I am not going to take you at 4.99. What I can suggest you don't go for all the back like don't go don't do a inquiry with the all the banks why because your bureau score will go down again and again they will pull your bureau. Oh. Oh. To check they will see a bureau. The bureau will get pulled again and again and again and again so your score will go down because it will go as an inquiry. But why are you going to but I don't have anything wrong. No no. Okay. The score always depends up sorry the interest always depends up to your score your company and your salary. No but why four will go down. No no they don't know like for example you're telling you one one customer will say I'm always pay on time a score is good. Okay. When they check the bureau the score is very less some he missed the payment he even doesn't know. No but I know I'm just saying I'm just saying they want to verify it because they want to check like how the customer is doing a payments. What is the score of the customer. What is the usage of the customer of the credit cards or a personal loan. That is the reason they check sometime what happens customer has a seven or eight credit card he closed it but still it reflects. It's still it reflects on the credit you know it still is reflect on the ATR Bureau it happens. So they always check first. Yeah but I don't think I'll have because I don't have too many credit cards the only thing which I have had a tip is with do because they have irritated the shit out of me they close my account and then I found out they have not lost my account and that I've had a fight with them. That also is some 40 dirhams which I will go and pay up again because again. Yeah but do is still is fine because that is a private. Yeah but otherwise I was okay at the start. You cannot mess with the at the start at the start is something different at the start if you're not pay a 10 dirhams also they will reflect on the bureau like right away. No but I don't feel like what they will give my company pays my bill so I will not have I'm just saying they do is still fine but at the start they always put on the bureau. No but I don't you can put for me because I already work for the company and the company pays all my bills so I don't have that and credit cards I don't believe in credit card so I never take loans. So I am the start that I have also it's minimum every month 100 or 200 dirhams that's it I don't use the credit card at all. No no so that should not be the bureau how it's going down I don't think so it cannot go down if you take loans then it will go down if you've never taken loans in your life. No no I will tell you ma'am if you're because you're doing inquiry with the different different banks the different different banks will reflect into your bureau. It always come whenever you do any inquiry it always come as you're trying to apply for it in the bureau how they had made it like that. For example if you had taken it it doesn't make sense you have not taken the loan see but taken the plan. Yes it's it's all the all the customers face the same thing but it's made from the central bank not from the outside it's made by the bank only not we had done it like this. This is no point. We designed like that only. But now without taking the pre-approval we are putting it in credit to go back this I am not understanding this rule really how it's making you understanding my point right. Yeah yeah I can I can understand ma'am but it's it's work like that only ma'am. Okay I don't know then I have no idea because I call I will of course call back to check my call 4-5 by myself. No you have done an inquiry calling it's something different if they are pulling your bureau like you're given a KYC documents. Like for example you're given an MRAC ID you are given. I'm not given any documents to any of them. You are not given the document that is fine they will tell you 2.5 also then rate until unless I will tell you how it works ma'am. Some people say verbally like I can give you 3.4 nights okay when it always depends up to your score and the company when they pull the bureau that only the score it comes it is automated generated by the software. They are every bank has their own software on that the it comes the interest rate. That is the reason every person will ask you first can you provide me the key 5-3 documents. Ambrit ID passport is valid either to get the exact approval that is called as a pre-approval and you will got to know what exact rate you're going to get. If you can be the standard they are just saying you just sake of it ma'am I can tell you if you can ask them tell me if you can just tell them to send me the email of it I will get this much only. They will say you okay first send me the document then only I can give you assurance because they have told me 4.8 fixed this is what standard charted always internet charted city bank HSBC will never give you less interest rate. They always give a higher with the local banks. Yeah so right bank has given me 4.99 and other bank some I took another commercial bank of Dubai, Ambrit MBD all were high 5 4.99 the only bank which was lower was FAB which was 4.24. We can give you that's what I'm saying they just told you verbally right they have not given any documents. No nothing on that. That's what I'm saying ma'am. Don't give any documents to anyone until unless you're not sure for those funds. Standard charted yesterday some of my documents but the forms are still not given so he's been pushing me give the forms I said I'll give it. Yes because he has to pull your bureau. That is the reason he's asking you. Till I don't sign the form he cannot pull my bureau. He cannot pull the bureau because that is acceptance form like I am giving authority to pull my bureau. Then I'm not giving that to. I'm not giving it to anyone. In the bureau in the ATR Bureau it will say you're done an inquiry on it. It will come as a count. Okay what we do we have tired with the all the banks will take one one Pree up one at the bureau we give that to everyone all the banks to come back to us and let us know on that what happened the customer scores will not get down and he will get all the information from it. And tell me one more thing I wanted to ask you one more thing because yesterday I called someone because after I finalized from these four points I said let me my friend and even the broker I'm speaking to very nice person. He I asked him do you know of anyone in mortgage because my friend told me just speak to a mortgage person once before you go through the bank. So when I went he gave me your contact and another person's contact. Another person told me don't even buy property right now he's like for me it's a benefit if you buy but don't buy because this is the highest inflation you are going to get it at not in terms of interest rates. Interest rates will always be whatever the same or high or low but property has reached the all time high. He's saying don't even buy so I got even more scared. Now I don't know what to do. I mean to my sense yesterday because he's saying don't buy and someone randomly telling you for him is it's like you tell me don't buy it because for you it's actually if I come on board it's good for you right because I. But imagine the person himself is telling me don't do it right now wait till I'm not here. I am so confused really in this Dubai I don't know anything about Dubai so it's very confusing every time I'm hearing different stories now you're giving me another story which I do not know. I'm telling you the truth that's how it works. No no no I told me the truth he said ma'am I'm telling you if you are not going to take loan from me I'm only going to suffer but I'm telling you as a because I believe if I'm honest then you will come back to me. Everyone they have their own targets they will tell you to do from me from not to do from other bank. So they will try to convince you and they will try to you know do it right away and get it done. He actually being an interest broker told me don't do from anywhere not because of the interest rate but because the property prices are very high he said it's the highest inflation. Why would he say that to me? That would have been it. I'm saying do one thing what I can suggest let's get the first pre-approval look for a properties with different different properties. In UAE that is in Dubai that is also a good thing you have so many developers you can check with a different type. Inflation is high then there makes no sense he is saying the property prices are at an all time high why you buying now everything is at least 20% up. Minimum he is saying even if you buy anything it will be 20 to 30% up. Property never gets come down in the industry. Property never comes down. Where are you from India ma'am? Bombay. Bombay I am also from Bombay. If you can see in Bombay if you are having a one BHK it never goes down. It's like a different right it's our country we know the market see here you are an Indian country one. Second I myself am seeing the property ratio for 900,000 just 8 months back. Now they are almost 1.3 from 800,000 to 1.3. It's increased right it's increased. So that's what I am saying ma'am if you are buying a property now again it's going to be increased there are no chances of getting the property will get decreased. I hope so because even like I remember friend of mine he bought in Princess Tower long back he bought it at 2.7 and now that property is not even worth 1.8. It's really bad and that was one of the prime properties at this time. So I am not like you know I can't say and if you know about Dubai you know Princess Tower is one of the best building. Before chap is gone in a million law. I can't say anything it's a risk you have to take. Any is that you at least get the... In every business there is a risk ma'am. You can't say there is no if you have to take the decision you have to take the decision. It's not small or whatever I'll see. Let's see please get the pre-approval. Let's see what the... Let us get the pre-approval look for a property if you like it go ahead if you didn't like to beat for it. At least you will get an idea how much you are going to get it. And how much what is the interest rate there is in the market. Correct absolutely no I agree with you on that. Okay so what do you need from my end? That's it that's it that's it the market advisor will give you a call. He will give you the information and he will ask you for the KYC. Don't give the KYC documents we will get all the interest rate everything he will let you know from all the banks. You can ask him from which bank water instead of just going off. Done done okay. Thank you ma'am thank you so much thank you for giving the time. Bye bye.\",\n",

       "  'content': {'text': \" Hello. Hello. Hello. Good morning. Good morning. Am I talking to Mr. Kenan? That's me, correct. Perfect. Mr. Kenan, my name is Naz. I'm calling you from the company Prefco Mortgage Services regarding the mortgage. Because you're planning to buy a property and you would like to take a mortgage under it, is that correct? Information? Yeah. Okay, perfect. So Mr. Kenan, I see that you're... for your salary and your income per month, it's 36 dirhams, right? Yeah, that's right. Okay, and you can pay 20% down payment? That's correct. Okay, perfect. Mr. Kenan, in order to understand that you're eligible, but as I see that your income is more than it's required to take a mortgage and you're available to pay 20% down payment, but still I just need a few more information to understand if you're eligible to take a mortgage. So please. Okay, perfect. Okay, nice. May I know your resident of Dubai? Yes, I'm resident of Dubai for the last 11 years. 11 years. Okay, perfect. May I know what's your age? 45. 35. 40. Oh, 45. Yeah, I wish 35. Everyone wishes one day. Okay. And may I know how long you're working with this company? The company I'm working for now, maybe four or five months. Five months. Five months. The question would be, obviously it's passed. Yes. Okay, okay, perfect. No one's sick. Okay, do you have any liability, such a car loan, personal loan? Yeah, car loan. I'm paying one five per month. And my credit card total is limited to 60,000. I'm happy to reduce the cover. Okay. 60,000. Yeah. Is it going to be fine? Like, I'm not a mortgage advisor, so I would just take your general information and I will forward your request to the mortgage advisor department. But I just wanted to ask you if they will ask you to reduce the limit of your credit card, is it fine for you? That's fine, but they would not ask because the mortgage I'm looking for, the mortgage I can take is 2.5 million with the current stats I provided to you. So you are not the first one I'm talking to. But I'm not even willing to take 2.5. Okay, okay, I see. Yeah. And the main one was your nationality, what was your take? I have the nationality, Turkish and British. I'm resident in the U.S. British system. Okay. Okay. So you're still looking for options, as I can see, right? You didn't still have any property yet? Looking for it also. Yes, we're in some properties already. And it's going to be ready to move in? Ideally. Do you guys give the mortgage off land? Yeah, so there's like requirement if the customer willing to proceed with the off land, the building, the percentage of construction should be ready at least for 50-60%. Only in that case you can go with the off land building. No, I'm looking to move in action. Okay, okay. And the value of the property you mentioned, like 2 million? No, look, I would do it reverse and you can give that information to the mortgage advisor that I make 20% payment and fine with it. I want the cost of the purchase to be incorporated in the mortgage and per month I'm not willing to pay more than 7500. So per month, let's go through that, not how much down payment or what is the value of the property is 7500. I want to pay. Okay, okay. I'm happy to pay. Let me put that back. Okay. And may I know if it's going to be your first property in Dubai? That's right. It will be the first one. And when are you willing to purchase it, like as soon as possible? As soon as I find something, it's my needs and my budget. Okay, okay. So, yeah, tomorrow can be. Yes? Tomorrow can be the month until I find something that I like within my budget. Sure. So Mr. Gannon, for now I have enough information from your site. So right now I will forward your request to the mortgage advisor and he will give you complete information. So can you tell me what is the convenience time for you to give him a call back? Like second part of the day. Around maybe three o'clock. Three o'clock today? Yeah. Okay, perfect. I will mention that. Okay. I'm looking for the fixed rate for three or five years minimum. Five years? Three or five years, ideally five years. And my salary goes to FAB and I have an offer from them already. I said you are not the first one. And it is below five percent. Below? If it is below. Anything about that? I would not pick off this rate because it would reduce the value of the property that I can buy. Okay. So if it's above that, there is no point to give a call either. Okay. Okay. I will mention that. So basically what is happening, so we are between the customers and the banks, like the major banks of Dubai. So he will take all the information like requirement documents and everything and we will see like which best offer we can get you from which bank. With the best rate. Yeah. That's not specified. I said if it is like below five. Below five, yeah. I don't know what I have given me is four eight nine. Four point eight nine. Four point eight nine. Okay. Okay. Above that I wouldn't consider because even if it is fifty, there are hams per month. And then you think about 20 years. This is a quite good amount of money can buy me a car. Okay. I see. Okay. Mr. Kenan, thank you for sharing your information. I will put everything like every detail in the additional notes and I will forward your request and they will hope they will give you a call today by three p.m. But if they won't give you today, like they will give you like as soon as possible because actually right now we have like a lot of requests. But people like for taking a mortgage. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I like it. That's fine. They can call me tomorrow as well. Okay. Perfect. Thank you for your time. Have a lovely day. Thank you.

That also you can do it. Then you will get an idea and you can finalize the property as per that, sir. Okay, is there by any chance you can increase the mortgage time? That, yeah, that mortgage advisor can do that, sir. That is you have to check with the mortgage advisor because different bank has a different policy. If there is any changes is there, he will help you and do that, sir. But it happened? That I can give you dark, cannot give you assurance. It depends up to the bank if they want.

Nowadays, they are all giving a good, the mortgage advisor will tell you the update, what offer is going on. So you will have, you know, 30 to 45 days to finalize the property. So tell them you can finalize the property, sir. But I can do the mortgage pre-approval before I select the unit. Yeah, you can do that. Because in this case, I don't know exactly how much is the unit or I just assume. You can do that. That's what I'm saying, sir, what you can do it. Let's get the pre-approval first. Okay, now you got the pre-approval, pre-approval, now you will know. I get a pre-approval based on what budget, you know. I will tell you, sir.

I just tell them what is the maximum I can get. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Can I do that? You can do that. You can do that. It is possible, sir. It is possible. Some customers know how much they want. In your scenario, you don't know the price, how much you can get. First, you want to know how much loan you can get. Once you know, then you will be clear in your mind how much you want to go for it and what's going to be a budget for you, sir.

       "  'content': {'text': \" Hello. Hello. Hi sir. Good afternoon Yasin again from Pripco. Yes, yes. You're right. Yes, speaking. Yes, yes. Okay. So I just had a conversation with the team regarding this golden visa and we just got a confirmation yes we can able to go ahead with this salary 27500 and that will be based on subject approval. And apart from that, as you mentioned she is working in a coil and gas company. So I would like to know how long she has been working with the company? I think she has completed one year. See basically she has been working in the company for three four years but before she was on a contract like a third party visa. Okay. And this visa has been more than one year. So with this visa it's more than one year. Yes. Okay. Let me check on that. Can I put you on hold for a minute please? Yeah. We should be completing on the same visa for three years. So since you said the visa has been changed with the same company then I will I need to recheck it out again on that. See the first I will explain to you so she works in Bay Curricules. Okay. Sorry what company name? Her company name is Bay Curricules. Let me tell that also we Bay the aka ER. Okay. Then space HUD HES. HES. Okay. Okay. So she has been in this company for four years. Four years okay. But before she was on a third party visa. So her visa was before from a company called Meetup. After that a company called Transguard and then she got a visa from Bay Curricules. But she has been in the same company, same team. Okay. Yes. So we can arrange an experience letter or we can arrange a letter which shows that we have she has been working in the same team. So that is why I just wanted to reconform if they can accept this with the letter if we can provide then I can just okay. Meanwhile, let me keep this separately. I just need few more details based on that I can just update the details in the system. So four years is completed as per your confirmation and the salary is exact 27500 or any other No, no. Salary has been 27500 from January last year. January 2022. January 2022 27500. It was first 26 something then it got increased to 27500. From January. I believe I don't know I don't remember when I can provide a salary certificate. Okay. Okay. No, she is saying and she said the visa mentioned as commercial manager. This is what it mentioned in the visa right. Yeah. The current visa mentioned commercial manager. So can I have the email address of miss Fika so that I can send an email in case because I need to recheck it about this company work experience. Once I got a confirmation what we do is we send an email stating that all the information about the golden visa then there will be a link which will be mentioned in the email after going through if you're ready to go ahead then you can click on the link you can pay 2000 the room for the pre-approval. But the charges for this is 16750 dirhams for the golden visa in case if you're going for a professional visa the charges will differ. So that will be mentioned in the email but I wanted to just reconform the email address so that I can put you across with complete detail information in the email. So it's Fika.max.money the thing that I have put in the script. Let me check one minute. So for managers it will be 11500 dirhams with the charges and the email address one I'm just getting that. And she can also take a dependent right? In yes over 18 years dependent there will be charges of 8500 below 18 years it's 8000 dirhams. And how much of it goes to you guys and how much of it goes to the government? I am not sure sir because this will be dealing with the golden visa team once I put you across with the golden visa team they are the right person to give you an update on that. All right. Okay. Just give me a minute. You have to give me an email address. This is let me spell out for you. It's F for Fox, A for Apple, Y for Yankee, I for India, Q for Quebec, A for Alpha, Dot, Nancy, Alpha, Quebec, Sierra, Hotel, Bravo, Alpha, Nancy, Delta, India at gmail.com. Yes. Correct. Okay. Yes. This is the professional visa. The professional visa is the one which is based on salary right? Based on salary and based on the visa designation. Okay. So if we are going through this, this will also be a 10 year visa? Yes it is. And as the government also will get? Yes. So the difference is if you are going with the investment like a property investment that visa where you will get spouse, children, parents, maid, driver, you can like sponsor them. But in this professional visa you can sponsor only dependent below 18 or above 18. That's it. So they also get a 10 year visa and. What do you mean by dependent? Dependent means like the spouse, kids, like our children's both. Okay. But not parents and. No. So this too can be provided. But anyways, regards to this, I just wanted to clarify about with the team regards to this for three years and one year working with the same company. If we can able to get the letter, then I will send you an email which will show all the detail information about this visa listing, pricing, everything. Then if you are interested, you can pay 2000 Rump for the pre-approval. So we will be pre-qualifying by from the government once we get it done. Then the team will be in touch with you to process the, you know, reminding things. So how long does it take usually? Usually it will take like two weeks max. Two weeks for pre-approval? No, no, no, no, for complete whole process. If you get a pre-approval once it is done, it will be two weeks max. But that is why I'm not particularly, you know, sure how long exactly it will take. When I send an email, just reply back to the email. One of the agent from the Golden Visa team will be in touch with you till the process complete. He'll be the only person who will be helping you out. Okay. Okay. Anything else I can help you with sir? That's it. Thank you Mr. Mawrashay. Thank you for your time. Have a good day. You too.\",\n",

       "  'content': {'text': \" Hello. Hello. This is Harvinder Yesar from Tripco Services. Are you looking for any mortgage? Yes. Yes. Let's see. Let's say I need a mortgage. Yeah. So I was just calling you that time. You had told me to do that. Okay. No worries. Okay. So it's a good time to talk to you sir. Raghasi mortgage sir. Yeah. Okay. So I just need some few details to check your eligibility. Okay. I just want to know are you residency or non-residency? Residency. Residency. Okay. Mehanu, what's your age sir? Thirty. You're age? Thirty three. Thirty three. Okay. And your salary or your self-employed sir? Ego. What's your salary? Your salary. Okay. Yeah. And Mehanu, like how much your salary? Forty. Forty thousand. Forty thousand. Okay. And Mehanu, since how long you're working in the same company? I was before you know that. Now I joined this one since December. December? Yeah. December means... You can say five months? Five to six months? Okay. Okay. May I know like how many credit cards do you have? I think I have four. Four. Okay. And what is the total limit? Approximately 150. 150K. Okay. Do you have any kind of a personal loan? No. I have a house loan currently. Mortgage do you have? You have mortgage? Yeah. Okay. And how much you're paying monthly for it? Seven thousand. Seven thousand you're paying for a mortgage? Yeah. And I have another pre-approved loan from another bank I'm going to use. As well as approximately eight thousand a month. Just give me a moment. Mortgage. How much you said? Seven thousand every month, right? Yeah. This is one, but I have approved another loan from another bank because I'm buying another property. Approximately eight thousand a month. Eight thousand. It means plus eight thousand and plus seven thousand you mean to say, right? The both. Correct. So why you're not thinking to do a buyout, sir? Everything you can come to a one mortgage, sir. If you have that, perfect for me. Let me try to do that, sir. There is a one more mortgage. So the mortgage I didn't use it. It's pre-approved. But if you can do a buyout where I can buy all the properties together first. So you want to buy an third property, right? Which is under mortgage? So I have now one and I have two of the properties. Okay. It will be handover three. I have three properties. They will be handover in the next two months. Okay. So I'm getting a loan to pay them off altogether. Each property already has been paid 45% of the value. Oh, that's very nice. Okay. May I know your nationality, sir? Venezuela. Sorry? Venezuela. Venezuela, right? Yes. Okay. And the plan is ready to move in or off plan? They won't right now. So let me explain. You have one. It will be ready to move in next month. I have another, I just bought, but I want the bank to pay the federal to pay the developer that remaining amount and I will pay the down payment. Okay. As well, we'll be ready to move next month. Okay. I have another one which has really 40%, 40% or 45% paid, which will be ready to handover in July or June. July or June. And let me see, oh, this is very inspection by the approach. Oh, that's very nice. Just let me write it down. So you can say has two properties already 40% paid? One property will be, I will pay, I don't know how much down payment has to be paid to be covered. So you have to make a calculation. Maybe I need to pay only 35% for all the properties all that by all together. So maybe you can make a calculation how much they already paid, how much you will give you loan, how much I have to pay. And for the second property you have paid 40%? 40% and 45% is on the ground. 45% Now this is more of a constant. The customer already paid. paid of plan. He will catch the and or in July, right? And over you will get in July. Sorry. And over you will get in June or July, June or July? June most probably. And now how much loan you are looking for sir? So you tell me how much we can get. So let me give you the value of the properties. Okay. So one value is one second. Don't close one second. Yes. Hi. How are you? One second. Just give me 35%. This one is where you can, this is only one, two clean only. And I think that's easy, easy as a simple, the main unit. You are big sir? Yeah, but not too much. That's right. Okay, yes brother. We can continue now. Yes. Hello. Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes. So we were saying, you were telling me the total value. Okay. So what I'm saying sir, I will take down all the details. Okay. Let the market advisor will give you a call and he can give you the exact figure how much you can get it. No problem. So you let me know what you need to know. Okay. And this will be your fourth property right? Or fifth property? So listen, I have one, this is with loan. Now that I have three loan as well. This way I need to get the loan. One more or no as well. So if you can give me to four, I will buy four. If you can give me to five, I will buy five. Depends on how much you can give me. Okay. Okay. I can give you the value of each property I couldn't have if you want. Okay. So what I will do, I will just tell the market advisor to give you a call now. Okay. Okay. Okay. They can give you the extra anymore. Okay sir. Thank you so much. I will be in a time. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye.\",\n",

I want to quickly ask you few questions so that I can have your profile and I will forward it to my mortgage advisor. They can take your case forward then. Okay. Okay, alright. You are a resident of Dubai, right? Yes. Meenu, how old are you? I am 36. Sorry, I didn't get you? 36. Okay, are you salaried or self-employed? Salary. Salary. How much is a salary? 18,000. 18,18. Yes. Okay, any additional income apart from this? I have some investment in Egypt but he is not one of them. Okay, okay, alright. How long have you been working with this company? 14, 15 years. 15, 14 years. Okay, any liabilities you have? Car loan, credit card? I have car loan. You have car loan? How much is that? I am paying 19,000 very much. You are paying 19,000? No, no, 1,900. 1,900 per month. Okay. Any credit card you have it? Yeah, I have almost all credit around 50,000 there. So I will consider two or three credit cards you have? Yes, yeah. Three credit cards, yeah. Yeah, that's okay, that's fine. It's just I can have your profile, yeah? So you are Egyptian as far as I got you, yeah? Okay. You hold Egyptian passport, right? This is the number four. Okay, so the property which you are planning to buy, is it ready to move in or off plan? Yeah, ready to move. Okay, and the price range is 1.1 million, right? No, 1.5. 1.5, okay. And this is going to be the first property in UAE. Right, yeah. Perfect. So what I will do is I will send all these details to my mortgage advisor. They will give you a call shortly, ask for your some documents and give you the best rates for the mortgage so that you can take it forward. Once you have the approval, you have almost 45 days to avail it to start with your property and then the mortgage is started. If you cross the period of 45 days, then you have to start it from the zero again. Oh, again, zero. Yeah. So within that period of time, please finalize the property, okay? You have signed almost two months, one and a half months. Okay, about some payments, okay? I have to have 20%. Yes, you have to pay 20% because the funds can give you only up to 80% mortgage. Okay, but once person 80% 20% it has to be currently now in our bank account. Or if I have like in 12 and once I have property, I will arrange it with money. See, what happens is say for example, you are finalizing the property, right? You went to the developer or you went to the broker, they are giving you the property, right? Then they will, you will give the expression of interest to them. Say for example, 10,000, 5,000. What is the remaining balance out of the total amount? 20% has to be paid from your side. Once the bank and the developer will see 20% has been paid by the client, then your mortgage will start. Okay. And for that, you also have some days to complete that down payment from the developer. Yeah. So you just have to check with the broker how many days you have to complete the down payment and then start the mortgage. That is up to you and... We don't have to have full amount there. Sorry? To get the initial approval, we don't, we are not required to have the full amount. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Pre-approval you can get and you will have an idea how much bank will give you and how much you have to put towards your property. Pre-approval can be done by anyone. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right.

Miss, I have received an inquiry from Skyweaver real estate from yesh that you were interested in taking studio in Aikonsti and you won't mortgage on that. Is that correct? That's actually right. Okay ma'am. I need to know few more details from your site so that I can take your case forward and my mortgage advisor can give you a call and proceed for your pre-approver. Yes, please. Okay. Are you a resident or non-resident? Non-resident. Non-resident. Okay. May I know ma'am your age? 43. 43. Okay. Are you salary there or self-employed? Yeah. Salary. Salary. Salary. May I know how much is a salary? One lakh 80,000 Indian rupees. Which is around 8,000 AED. Ma'am, do you have any extra income? I mean additional income. No. I do have an income which is very variable every month. So it's like 20,000 to 40,000. I will put it nevertheless. Even one time you can make a difference. Yeah, but then it won't make much of a difference because it's very variable every month. Okay. All right. And it's in a different bank account in my case. And ma'am can I ask you one thing? Are you maintaining 25,000 dirhams every month which is not about 6 lakh or 6.5 lakhs every month should be undetected in your account? No. Some months it will be variable. It will be very variable because I have made transfers to other accounts. If we talk about last, if we talk about say for example last six months, are you able to maintain 6 lakhs? Every month won't be that way. It's variable? It is variable, yes. Because I have made payments to something and then the money has been refunded again back to me. So at the end of the month maybe that balance may not show. What will be the average balance if we say for last three months? Around 3-4 lakhs like every month. I mean like I can send you my statement if you want to. 3-4 lakhs is your average which you are maintaining? Every month it is 3-4 lakhs because some months has been 39 lakhs and all that also. Like November was I think 39-40 lakhs or something. Right. In January? And then I have taken fixed deposits in the month of January. So obviously the balance came down because I took fixed deposits worth around 35 lakhs or something like that. From my bank account I purchased 6 deposits which is in the bank only. If you want I can send you a statement of that too. That on that day you will be able to carry that the fixed deposit and the amount which has been transferred is to the fixed deposit. Okay. That way. Okay I will put it in additional details. Okay. Yeah. How long you been working with this company? I have been working for four years. You have been working for four years. Okay. It is a private clinic I am working. I am not working for a company which has salary certificates and all that. So I have to make a salary certificate also whatever is needed because we do not get any salary certificate or anything. It is a private clinic. So on the letterhead of the doctor I have to make a salary certificate that I am working here since this date till this date. Then you can pick more like if we say minimum is required here is 10,000. Okay. Yeah. Let's just see if the mortgage advisor can advise you the best. So you are working there in three years. But my boss will not write more salary certificates. Okay. All right. May I know your liabilities? I do not have any liabilities. No liabilities. No credit card, no personal loan, no home loan. I have full credit card but I do not use my credit card or whatever. But what is the limit you have taken on that? I have some I see in the form of a credit card. The limit you have taken on that? I have some I think 90,000 or something which is the credit card. 90K INR. Okay. That is only one. I just have one credit card. Okay. And you hold Indian card? I also think that yeah I hold an Indian card. But I think there is an increase in my limit to 6 lakhs, 20,000 or something. So not wrong. 6 lakhs? Yeah. Okay. I have been maintaining a very good balance. So I mean but I have not used a credit card. I do not use my credit card. So 6 lakh INR your limit yeah? I think that is what the bank has made it. I do not use my credit card so it does not matter to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am just putting it just for their information. So the property which you are planning to buy over here in UAE is it going to be ready to move in or off plan? It is I think I can sit here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what is the range of that studio which you are buying? The studio is 8 lakhs. So it is like a second-tier marketing I am buying. Okay. 800K. Okay. This is going to be the first property in UAE right? Yes, that is right. And when are you planning to buy it? I am planning to buy it right away. Okay. Immediately. Okay. All right. Ma'am, I just have to check the eligibility because of your maintaining balance which is the last 6 months. If you say you are saying average I have to take 3 to 4 lakhs. I will check with my mortgage advisor and if they say yes we can do it. You will get a call from mortgage advisor immediately to ask for your document. You are a bank statement? No, not me. You will share it to them only. They will check. Okay. Because like it is variable. It is like you know as I said, the summer at 40 lakhs, December at 6 lakhs. I put it as an additional detail but you have high transactions and they will take this case forward. Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you for your information. Have a wonderful day. No problem.

I'm good. How are you? I am good. Thank you so much for asking. I have received an inquiry from Banker Real Estate that you are interested in taking mortgage for the property. You are looking for one bedroom apartment, right? Yes. Yeah. And you want to check the eligibility? Yes. Okay. I quickly have to ask you a few questions so that I can tell you and take your case forward. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. You are a resident of Dubai, right? Correct. Perfect. May I know how old are you? I am 27. 27. Are you a salary or a self-employed? Salary. How much is a salary? 13,000. 13,000. Is there any other question? Yes. Is there any other additional income you have? No. This is the dot which comes to your account every month, right? No commissions, nothing, right? No. Okay. All right. How long have you been working with this company? It will be a year in June. Almost a year. Okay. Any liabilities you have taken like car loan, loan, credit card? Nothing. No. No, no credit cards. That's good then. What's your personality? I mean, which passport you hold? Indian. Okay. All right. So the property which you're planning to buy, the Banbedroom apartment, it's ready to move in, right? If I'm not mistaken, yeah. Yeah. Okay. There's a couple of places that I'm looking at. Because you know, I'll tell you one thing, I'll suggest you one thing, go for ready to move in because it's easy to get mortgage on the ready to move in unit rather than off the mortgage. I have a question about that. So if it's ready to move in and it's easier to get a mortgage on that, but wouldn't that mean I'd pay more money for the mortgage in terms of interest rates and things like that? No, it's not that. See, how does it work is off plan, if the project is off plan, you have to wait for the 50% construction and the 50% almost payment has to be done from the client by then. Okay. So the client can put it on mortgage whereas in while the unit is ready, you have to only put down payment which is only 20% for the total value and rest up to 80% is given by the bank. And rate is not directly proportional to anything ready to move in and off plan. Rate is from the bank, pencil bank. Right now it's going down and we will ensure that we will get you the best rate and you have a choice to choose which bank you want to go with. Okay. Okay. And how much is the services from your end? It's free of charge. Oh, okay. Yes. Yes. Me and you know the price range which you're looking at. What's the price range for the property? It's between 900,000 and 1.5 million. Okay. I don't know if that's too much. Yeah, it's fine. We can try. And this is going to be the first property of yours and you. Okay. Yeah. That's pretty much it. Miss Amy, what we will do is we will give you a call from my mortgage advisors. They will take your case forward and ask you for the documents and then you will get a pre-approval as soon as possible. Okay. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much.

And then basis that I wanted to go ahead. So I've done the process already with ADCB. I'm just waiting for the letter to come through. The pre-approval letter. So apart from ADCB, I wanted to explore with you guys. I spoke to Ahmed from Metropolitan. He mentioned that you guys are, you know, you guys have a wide range of mortgage experts who can actually support. Exactly. And we are dealing with all the banks in the way. So you might get a better offer compared to ADCB. Exactly. So what I can do, if you can please on the same mobile number send me a WhatsApp with your email ID, I'll forward you a document packed.

Thank you very much. I'm calling with reference to your inquiry for mortgage. You're looking to purchase property in the by-land, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Correct, correct. Okay. So actually we got your details from one of the real estate brokers and you know, they have informed us that you're looking to purchase this property with mortgage. Yeah, correct. Okay, great. So in order for us to check the eligibility, I would like to have few details. Okay. Yeah. Can I know, are you a resident in UA or a non-resident? I'm a resident in UA. You're a resident in UA. I'll just note the information down one moment. And you own a company? You're or you're working? No, I'm an employer. Okay, so you're working? Can I have your monthly salary? 10,000. Okay, it's exactly round figure, 10,000, right? It's completely 10,000 only. And I have a commission for it as well because I'm into it. I mean, I'm working for insurance. So I do have a commission now, commission now also, which comes every quarter. Okay. Oh, all right. So on an average, like if you divided by 12 as in the last one year, can you tell me what will be the total salary plus like 10,000 terms as your basic? 10,000, it will be 120,000 per time. And commission, you can say, from the need to 200,000. So let's say 200,000 divided into 12. Yeah. That will be approximately 16,666. Plus 10,000, it will be around 26,600. Yeah. Yeah. Wonderful. So I'll just mention your including your incentives, but once you speak to one of the mortgage experts, you can just let them know as well that this is your salary plus commission. Sure, sure, sure. And if there really any sort of document also where they want to see the commission things or that is also possible. See, basically they request for bank statements. So I think that will not be a problem for you. You can just pull them out from your online banking or you can present your last six months bank statements. No, no, no, we can do it. Sure. And how long have you been working for this company? This is my second year, one and a half years I have already completed. Before that I was in the Orient in 12 for almost six years. So almost six years in this company and let's say in now you were. Six years in before company. Okay, I got you now. So in total you are here in this country for about 7.5, 7.5. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. All right. And this is your first property? Yes, definitely. And I do not have any sort of liability like a card. I have a good family, but there is no. Yeah, so my credit rating is absolutely perfect. That's great. So can I just ask you the credit limit of your credit card which you have? I have two cards with me. One is a credit, one is a city bank that is of 15,000. And one is a standard card that is 30,000. So approximately 45,000 in total. Yeah. Okay, great. The only reason why we are asking this is because your Alif Teha Bureau report will be pulled. So all your. You can do everything. I agree. That is not my picture is coming because the first thing I said, I don't know if you have to pull it out or show it because it's a body missing. So you can find any source of questions. Thanks for updating that and you know, and what about the price or the value of your property which you're purchasing? See right now, I have given my budget to the sales area and we will say that somewhere in the state and down payment of 120, that 20% of down payment has to be up and right. Yeah, exactly. That's given to many, that you will manage. Right. So what was the total value? Sorry, I did not get that. What was the total value? 550. 550. Yeah. Okay. So that will be 500. Let's take a round. 600,000. Yeah, that would be fine. All right. And just one moment. You're from India, right? Yeah. Sure. So just let me know if in case you have already decided the area of you told me Dubai lands, right? So. Yeah, area is not excited. No, no, no. I'm just looking for options where I will be getting a good committee plus my daughter small. I need to see where the schooling is also nearby. Exactly. I have to see all those things before panning the area. So Dubai land is a prosperity because Jens is very near in Iran and I have asked the face person also of the reason to recommend me any other area which is suitable for my budget and my other other things which is my requirement. Understood. So hopefully she will give me other options as well. Yes. So area is in Kashan now. It's not yet decided. No, it's just that absolutely fine. So once you decide the property, until then once we will have the approval and Han will call you and update you with other details. And if you wish to go ahead, you can go ahead with the same approval. Then you have time to decide on the property part. No issues. Okay. And my wife is also a machine. She is in the wind only. She is also having a percent of 10,000 if required. So maybe you can use the both bank account heads. Right. We will try with your individual ownership in case if it doesn't work or we require your wife to intervene, then we will let you know and we can consider her profile as well. So I will anyway mention a note that you are okay with the co-applicant. So you want to have a supplementary owner. First thing for me only, I don't want her to involve you. But it's required. If it is a question, definitely we can expose it up from there. Exactly. Just to get the best offer. Right. So in that case, she can involve you. Generally, what is the rate I am interested in? The interest rate differs from bank to bank, but we will check the eligibility first and depending on your at the heart bureau score and your bureau profile, they will be considering the offer for you from the bank. And then we will be coordinating it to you, the mortgage experts and next 48 hours. My account bureau will be fantastic because I have not. Right. Because you said that you don't have any outstanding on the card. I can't use credit card, but I use only personal information. For example, if I am buying from the jewelry and I put up on to the short-time, for that purpose only I can use my money. But I don't use it only. Right. That's not an issue. It's absolutely fine. I am sure my reading will be perfect from the SEP bureau. But I want to mention one more thing because for example, 680 is the value I give it to you. 20% of the property means 120,000 I am paying up front to the bank property. Right. So this will be remaining with the bank. 80%. This will be mortgage, right? Exactly. Yes. My question is suppose because I am working on a commission basis, this commission basis. If I am getting a good deed or if I am able to arrange some well come out in the way of the idea, how that one, right? Can I pay it like you know, like 125,000, 30,000 extra, like in the second quarter, 30,000, quarter extra amount is with me. And I go and deposit, that reduce my principal amount of money, how it goes. See, I believe that you can restructure at any point. Basically after 6 months you have an option to restructure the loan from the bank itself. If you wish to, you know, lessen the tenure, you can do that if you want to, you know, lengthen the tenure or increase the months of the tenure, you can do that as well. It depends on bank, you know, policy. So that only we have to check which bank are we going ahead with and then the mortgage advisor will be telling you all the TMCs, you know, from that particular bank. Correct. So I don't want to pay for spending my 35 years because at the last five years, it's a lot of interest as well. That is the portion I want you to cover as well. Maybe in the next six, seven years, I want to complete the entire thing, but I am taking the mortgage. I'll put a note of all your queries which you have. So, you know, once the mortgage expert will look into it, he will know that all questions he has to answer to you. So don't worry. Yeah, because we are just, you know, we Indians are having a tendency of saving, saving, saving, saving, correct? Yes. Definitely. That is quite a human behavior of Indians, you know, maybe Asians you can say. Yes. Or is it smart move? It's a good thing actually. Every year, definitely we will end up saving some amount that's about 30,000, 40,000 amount it's supposed for an year we are able to save. That's 40,000, you know, if I am paying to the bank, like how it goes, they will reduce my interest or they will reduce all those things I want you to understand. Right, right. I understand that. No issues. So, Mr. Sarthak, you can expect a call in next 48 hours. One of the mortgage expert will get back to you and once required, they will be asking from your company, right? Exactly, from FRIPCO services only. So we are actually calling the clients to take down all the details and the information then we evaluate the best deal for you and one of the mortgage expert will get in touch with you on the next level. Okay. So I'll just drop the call now and thank you very much for the details. Have a great day ahead. Bye-bye.\",\n",

       "  'content': {'text': \" Hello. Hello. Good afternoon ma'am. This is Harvinder calling from Pripko ma'am. How are you? I'm very good. How are you? I'm fine ma'am. Thank you for asking. Yeah. I believe you're looking for the property, like you're looking for the mortgage right? Yeah. Yeah. So I just need some few details to check your eligibility ma'am. Okay. Are you resident in UE or non-resident? Yeah. Resident. Okay. May I know like how much your salary? It's 1515. 1515. Yeah. But then it's been just three months that now it has become 15 earlier. It was nine. Okay. That is why I could not apply for the mortgage earlier. Yeah. Now before you ask me questions, I just want to just summarize my case with you. Okay. So I had already been in touch with the, you know, just landing this one. What's the name of the brand? Lending Treats. Right? Okay. Yeah. So what they have advised me is that I have to wait for like six months time statement. And 15 is the minimum salary that most banks approve of. And that's how I can get it. I wanted to apply for the mortgage if I can get it earlier. I don't want to wait for six months. Okay. Now in that case, I saw that one of the Instagram videos of this person, what's his name? Hussein, I guess. Hussein Sajjani? And no, not Sajjani. The other guy is Egyptian. Okay. So Instagram is also, he had mentioned your brand. Okay. And he must have given my number to you. So whoever he gave, so I shared my number with him and then you, that's how you got my number. Anyway, anyway, so he did mention that he likes his house. He's 10 or so, then there are certain banks were ready to give the mortgage. Yes. Yeah. So I wanted to know from you one, which bank, second, this is my set. So for past three months, I saw he was 15 and before that it is nine. Okay. So in that case, does that make sense? Second, I had taken a personal loan earlier, which I had already paid off last month itself. So my personal loan was around $165,000, out of which I've only paid $100,000. And my balance is around $24,000, which I'm planning to pay this month itself. Okay. Yeah. I have two credit cards, one city bank, which is around $18,000. The other one gives me around $20,000. Just let me take the leaders down. Okay. Me, I know what's the fee? $33,000. $33,000. Okay. So how long you working in the same company? Two years already. Okay. Yeah. And just came out. Okay. Two years. Okay. And how many credit cards do you have? Two. So what is the total limit? Around $35,000 or $38,000. Okay. Do you have any kind of a loan? No. I did take one or $24,000 remaining. I paid off. How much you're paying monthly? $4,500. Sorry? $4,500. $4,500. Yeah. So that's, yeah, that's not what you know, because I already paid off the major chunk, right? So this month it should have been lesser, but then this is what I opted for because I want to clear it in another three to four months. What I can suggest to this clear it up, how much is outstanding this month? $24,000. I can do it this month. That's not a problem, but I would do it only when I know that my mortgage would be ready and I would want to do it for two months. Okay. Okay. Next Nalini? India. Malhotra. Because Indians are mostly with other nostalgic Indians. No, no, no. Even if you won't talk in Hindi, I'm cool. You're from India, right? I'm from Jappi. Yes. I'm trying to add action to the camera. Okay. So you tell us about the two-hour picture so that I can plan it properly because I've already planned it for two to three months. I know that people in London can't get me, but I was thinking if I can get somewhere in August, September. Okay. No issue. Are you looking for ready to move in or off-land? I'm ready to move in, most probably. How much loan are you looking for? I am keeping two options in my head. One, I'm thinking of a 2BHK of around 700-800. Or the other option I'm considering is to buy a Mac Villa for around 1.2 or 1.3. So I know... We'll buy it 1.3. Directly we'll go for a Mac. Again, please. No, we'll go for a Mac like 1.3. Okay. So we can consider somewhere around 1, okay? I can give the down payment. You can consider somewhere around 1.3. Okay. And 20% you have to do a down payment. Yeah. 80% you get the mortgage, right? Yeah. And this is going to be your first property, right? Yeah. Insha'Allah. Okay. And when you're planning to buy a property? In another three months or so. By August, September. The thing is that once you finalize the property, you will only have to 40 to 45 days to finalize it. Two months, according to where I get. Yes. So is that okay for you? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you can write once the loans get approved and only you will finalize the property, right? Yeah. My plan is also if I can get a personal loan after that. Because I would want to get some personal loan also for the down payment. So I have to get a lot of personal loan. Somewhere around the time when I'm expecting. So you can do that regardless of me. Yeah. I'm property guy. So for example, I'm finalizing something 7 hundred thousand, right? So I suggest to him that you cancel the credit card as well. Both? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I can do that. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So what I will do is I will send the ticket to the market advisor. Okay. Okay. So they will let you know exactly what the interest rate and from which bank you can apply for. Okay. And how do you live? You live directly from the bank. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. You are my customer. I can give you a lot of time. No. Whatever best you can do. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye. Bye.\",\n",

That is the reason I sought pre-approval. Okay. So what do we will do sir? First let us go for the pre-approval. Okay. Once you get the pre-approval you are having a 45 days. Try to finalize the property. If you can that is good. And at least... But if you cannot then at least you will having idea how much you are going to get it? Right. And if say you take your play for pre-approval right now. Right. My salary is 5,000 a month. But after a month or 15 days or 20 days I think please my salary to say for example 15,000. Then it should be there. If you are increasing your salary the salary should be credit to your account. Right. Yes. But that is... How much they will like making a salary is like... I am not sir. May be 14, 15, 16... Okay. Just bear with me. Just give me one moment. Just okay. Just bear with me. Okay. Yeah. Thank you for being on hold sir. I have just checked with my boss. He is saying you have to give us the increment letter plus the salary should be credit for one month. Right. Okay. So we can... You can get like we can change on it. That is not an issue. Okay. Also another thing I want to check. So right now you are calling from SIPDA. Right. Yes.

So we will tell you from this bank you are getting this interest rate. From this bank you are getting this interest rate. From this bank you are getting this interest rate. So whichever bank you want to go for it, we will do everything. The documentation everything. You no need to go to the bank. You no need to ask for any agent from the inside the bank. We will do end to end service for you. And we do not take charge for it for any services as well. Okay. All right. Then in that case I think we will apply for pre-approval. Let us see what my eligibility is and based on that we try to find a property. Yeah. So what I will do, I will just send the details to the mortgage advisor. The mortgage advisor will get back to you on this. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.\",\n",

Yeah, I'm just calling to understand we got your number from Metropolitan that you're looking at. So I just need half a minute of your time to understand your profile. So I'll just say at Indian time I can have our mortgage advisor call you. Okay, perfect. Yes please. So have you already finalized the property or you're yet to finalize? No my dear, I still don't even have my residential visa. I'm working and I'm in the process of getting my resident visa in a company and me and my partner we're both working and each of us is getting $15,000 a month. So our income is around $30,000 a month. Okay. I did want to know what is the term of getting a mortgage because like as I said like usually in three to six months salary income we qualify for a mortgage and then the person told me not necessary there are some companies that can guide you without the three month statement of salary income for myself. So yeah, this is my situation right now. I want to know if there's any ways I can qualify to apply for a mortgage and then if I do then I can go and look for property and confirm because I need to first know right even qualify for it. You know what I mean? Sure, I agree, I agree. Now I just want to understand one thing from you. Are you having like you will be having your own business or you will be employed there? I'm currently employed already but my visa is in the process of having my job for the past two months. Okay. My visa is under process for my resident visa. So just because my visa has not been processed yet I couldn't get my salary in my account. Otherwise I would have had two summer season. Agreed. I'm going to need cash. Sure, sure. Thank you so much for all the details. Yes, you're absolutely right. So your salary is 30,000 that you said right? It's a 30,000, my partner is 15,000 combined with 30,000. Okay, okay. 15,000 but the combination is for 30,000 altogether. All right. And may I know your originally from which country? We are both British. British, okay. And so you're looking basically for both of them or only on one person because to qualify for a mortgage you require 10,000 salary which you already qualify. Okay. Yeah, but I can qualify on my own then that's great. It's not the machine combined. It's helped to increase the property value. Yeah, we can definitely check that. Also, the elevator and key hands up please do forgive me. You can call me back. No, that's fine. Sure, sure. Definitely. Because sometimes there's no signal. Yes, I agree. And may I know how old are you? Can I call you back? Can you call me back in like a few minutes? Yeah, sure. I'll call you back. Because I'm losing signal. Thank you. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay.

I had purchased a card taking a credit of 20,000 from my company only. Okay. Because my company. Yeah. I have salary deduction. Okay. But I have 20,000. Do you have any paper or something to show? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I do have a pay slip. Okay. And how much is the deduction every month? 6,066,660 rounds. 6,660. Okay. This is a high amount. And when is this... So over. Over. It's over this month. It's over. Perfect. So that is also the result. In case this is a concern it's already resolved. In case your next... Your pay slips justify that the deduction is over. It should not be a problem. No, my pay slips... Okay. And in one month I had gone on a leave because of which I received only 2000 dirhams salary because I had gone on a vacation. That also my pay slips is. Perfect. They're not a problem. See if you have... Because I was... ... documents, no problem about it. I have all documents. I can give you the proof of every single thing that I have whatever I'm saying to you right now. No problem sir. So your later... What is your idle salary date every month? 23rd. 23rd. So this 23rd how much did you receive? Was it deduction... Deruction of 6k? Orbit deduction. Yeah. This was my last PMI. Approximately 8 to 9k you've got? 9400 dirhams. 9500 dirhams. Okay. And your pay slips shows it right? Yeah. My pay slips shows it. My pay slips shows 15000 minus 6000 666. Okay. No problem then. Everything is workable sir. It's not a problem. You can manage everything then. Okay. Correct. And probation confirmation if you tell me then I go to my company and ask them for a confirmation. That will be required sir. They will require this document in case you're giving the probation confirmation then nothing to worry about. We'll get the loan done for you. Okay. So I... And we work with all the major banks in UAE so you don't have to worry if there is one bank which is very strict or adamant about something we have other options. There are banks which have exceptions and deviations also. Okay. There was one idiot whom I used to deal with in Emirates and Bedi Bank who had applied my loan, not loan, credit card around 2-3 times without my permission. Okay. I have a documentary proof of that also. Yeah. They do that ECB check randomly without client's permission once they have your Emirates ID access. Correct. Because of which now I think I got demoted to some categories also. Okay. A category, B category. They have scores, credit scores. Okay. So this guy has done this shit and he's reduced my score basically and I don't even know when this happened. Okay. Your score is more than 600 not to worry. It will be okay. Okay. Okay. Can you check? How can we check that? See it's two ways. Either you check it, you'll be charged for it, you have to pay for it, you can check whenever you want. There's an ECB application for it. Okay. In case you're checking there are three ways to check. You can only check your score. The other is you can download the entire report. Since you arrived in UA, your ECB gets generated. Okay. So that report will show you how many credit cards you have, what is your utilization, how many times you have applied for the credit card, how much payment you're making, how much is outstanding, what is your credit card limit, how many loans you have applied, everything shows in that report. Now that in case you're downloading with the report, the charges 100 dirhams plus WAT which comes to 105. Okay. So if you download only the report without the score, then it is 84 dirhams. And if you download only the score, no report, then it will only tell you what your score is which will cost you around 30 or 40 dirhams. There's no preview out for this. No, that only we will, in case the bank is doing it for you and someone is telling you verbally that that is all, no one will say the ECB report because it's a very secure document. It's a centralized document, centralized bank. So if you do your ECB, someone will tell you that this is your score in the report and this is your ECB history or something. Got it. So we can go ahead then. We can go ahead. If these four things are okay with you, whatever I told you the issues. Yes. I don't think so. This is going to be a major challenge. These are all minor things with paperwork. Everything will get cleared. Okay. Got it. So I'll get the call arranged. One of my mortgage officer will contact you within 24 hours. Most likely it will be today, but within 24 hours you'll get the call. He will tell you the rates and charges of different banks. He'll check with you whether you want the fixed rate or the floating. There are different banks with different offers. You know about it, right? How mortgage works. Correct. Correct. So there are some banks which will give you three years of fixed rate and then after that it becomes eBor and fluctuating. And there are some banks which give you eBor and fluctuating from the beginning. So we'll give you multiple options. Accordingly you can choose. We don't charge you anything. The service is free of cost. Got it. So you'll get a constant. This is a more likely option then. So the best is honestly three years fixed and then fluctuating because in that three years if you don't, after three years if you don't want to continue with eBor you can anytime change the bank. There is buyout option. So at least when you're being fixed you know this is the amount and interest. Which loan can I get easily? But then. Which loan as an agent understand the question. Is there any bank that gives out loan to you with not too many stringent? The best when it comes to mortgage is Dubai Islamic Bank, Commercial Bank of Dubai, FAB which is first Abu Dhabi and RAC. These are the four most preferred banks. Okay. END and all they are very good for personal loans and banking experience but for mortgage it is not one of our top five banks. Okay. Got it. So it is easy to get in these four banks I presume then. It is easy. We have good types. We have good contacts in the bank in case of deviation something or the other to be done we can manage it for you. Okay. Okay. So you will get to hear from us within 24 hours. So my colleague will call you and assist you further. Sure. Sounds good. Thank you Mr. Adityan. All the best to you. Thank you. Thank you.\",\n",

       "  'content': {'text': \" Hello. Hello, good afternoon. Yes, good afternoon. This is Hadid. I'm calling you from Prepto Services. How are you doing? Yes, I'm fine. And how are you doing? I'm good. Thank you for asking. Now, I'm calling you in the gift of your interest in property mortgage. So, I'm just going to confirm this with you and see how can we help you. Why don't I follow you? Just repeat. Are you interested in property mortgage? Property mortgage. Yeah. Bank financing for property. Bank financing. How much? It depends on what you're looking at. Are you looking to purchase property in UAE? Then how much is to invest in how many times, how many years, and how much is the mortgage? It's not like that. It should be calculated based on your incomes, your age. So, I need information from your side in order to calculate all these things. It's not like this. And what is the cost of the property minimum? What bed room apartment? It's based on the location and the project as well. Then how much need to be invested in for me first time and how much number? First of all, this will be a property to move in or it will be a property to be constructed in some years. Are you a resident of non-residents? No, not resident. For non-residents, they cannot take mortgage for a planned project which is under construction. You can take mortgage only if your property is ready. Property is ready, mortgage. And if I am a resident, then I can have a property mortgage in construction. But it will not... then there is... the benefit is very limited because the property is not ready. So that we can achieve the rent out of it to pay off. That means... So, for the outside, what do you say? Are you looking for ready property or off plan? Pardon? Are you looking for ready property or under construction? Ready property. How much? One bedroom apartment, minimum, how much will be the cost? In any area? In Dubai? Your project? No, availability. Yeah, if property never used or... ...the second market or country market? I don't follow you. You are from a rich country. Algeria. Algeria, okay. Okay, so okay. Let's speak in English, okay, no problem. So, I mean... Budget is very limited, my budget is very limited, but I am interested in the way that I can invest minimum amount and rest of the money to view from the rent. So... Anyhow, we need to know what's your budget. I don't know if it's different or not. The person is different. There are people who said, okay, my budget is 800 dirhams. Other people had their budget is 1 million, 3 million. Based on yours, you should know what's approximately. Say, what about 100 or 200,000 dirhams? 200,000 dirhams, you cannot get even a studio like this. It's really... it's okay to get a studio with 2,000. That is why I am asking what will be the minimum amount so that I can check my position. Yeah. If I talk about studio, like minimum should be like 300. 300 or 350 square feet like that. Yeah. But you cannot... even you cannot get a mortgage for property value 300. To get a mortgage, you should... property should be more than 500,000. 500,000. More than 500,000. Okay. So out of... Okay, if it is more than 5,000, say about 5,000. 5.5. 5.5 lakhs or 600,000. So what will be the amount to pay in the beginning and what will be the mortgage? You should pay 250. And the mortgage maximum will be 250 from the bank. Okay. And it will be a ready property to move in? Yes. So that means... And that means the ready property and what will be the time for the rest of the mortgage period to pay off? From your age. From case to case. For that I need to ask you a few questions if you don't mind to answer. First of all, you're not resident here. No, yes. May I know your age? My age is 60 plus. But my... Yes. 60 years plus. 61, 62. 65. 65. You cannot get a mortgage. You cannot get a mortgage for... But if my son whose age is around 30 years, 33 years, he can get a mortgage. How much... How much... What is the limit of the mortgage year? It's not like that. It's not like that. I need to know this information. Then we'll calculate for how many years he will pay off. What's the limit of the mortgage? He's 30. Is he a salary employee? Pardon? What do you say? Is he a salary employee? Yes, he is a salary employee in Germany. Okay, what's his salary? I have to check. I don't ask him. My son is there. If I cannot have a mortgage, then I can ask my son to have a property mortgage in place of me. But he is around... He must be earning around 3000 Euro. 3000 Euro. Okay. Is he... Does he have a passport in Germany or he has nationality only in Pakistan? He has nationality and passport both in Pakistan but he has a residence permit, permanent residence permit. For how long he's working with the Turei company? He is working in different company in Germany, not a single one. He switched one from one another, maybe six months or one year. He has been working but he is working in Germany for the last three years. Do you know if he has any car loan, personal loan? No, nothing. Credit cards? No. The property review. We will put a price like 500,000 because this is the minimum. Okay. Okay, so one of the mortgage advisors will contact him if you don't mind to give me his number or do you answer on behalf of him? Better give me my number so that I can first of all have got all the information and we will discuss with my son and then we will communicate to him. And you can send me details of your budget and availability and on my discount number on WhatsApp with your name. And one of one thing to play, what will be the if the mortgage is how long, which period? The mortgage period will be maximum how much? For him maximum 30 years. Maximum 30 years. So the mortgage, the rent, mortgage part of payment, what will be the mortgage part of payment per year or per month? It's based on his salary. They need to confirm his salary. You should ask him again for his salary. So we will offer him this first. And again, when you go to decide what you need to give you need his salary certification or he needs his salary slip or what you will need. We need salary certification. We need the statement of account bank account. Okay. And one thing, if we go for the 500,000, 5,000,000 property, ready property, what will be the rental income? Based on the location. Yes. You know, just an idea so that we can calculate to get it back to repay how much time it will get to repay. I cannot answer like this because we are not selling property. You should choose the property and we will help you on the mortgage. The person who will say you should answer this question. You are the only person for the finance. Yes. So you are from a bank or rich company? Prypto. Broker's company. Prypto. Is this a government company or a private company? Private. Private company. So your company will mortgage and finance the property company? No. The bank who will finance, we help him to get the mortgage. You will help the bank will mortgage and finance and you will help to give them a mortgage from the bank. Right? Is it? So can you give me your details of your company on my WhatsApp so I can look at it? Right? Okay. Okay. This is your name. I need to confirm with him the salary because 3,000 he cannot get the mortgage. It should be above 3,500. Maybe I have to check. Maybe I have to check first. Yeah, for that I'm telling you because the mortgage advisor will contact you and ask for the salary. Okay. But in the meantime you send me your company's profile or company's information introduction so that I should be aware of your company's contribution. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. What's that? I'll have this. I'll have this. Sure.\",\n",

Investor. Investor Visa. Okay, great. So I'd like to understand a few details to check the eligibility for the investor visa. So do you have any investment of 750,000 rhythms? Yes. Okay, great. And right now for the investor visa, I just need few details so that I can send you an email in regards to this. Then the team will be in touch with you. There is an advisor and they will assist you in processing your request. So I'd like to get your email address first. Can you help me with your email address, please? Okay.

But before that, I wanted to understand what is the total investment you have? Do you have something like more than 2 million? No, it's not 1 million. Okay. So then you can go for investor visa where you'll get it for two years with, you know, you can sponsor your dependent, like either it is over 18 or below 18, you can sponsor them. And for your investor visa, the charges will be 16,750 dirhams. Why? Sorry? The last person I spoke to said it shouldn't be more than 10. Why is it so? Now the government charges has been increased. So normally the charges from the government itself is like between 11 to 12,000 approximately. And reminding is the service freeze from us. So that is why I'll be forwarding you an email where you can be in touch with the advisor from the visa team and you can have a word with them.

So there will be a link for 2000 dirhams to be paid. I would recommend you to be paid later once you get all the confirmation about this visa. Then you can go out and do the payment for pre-approval from the government. So the LD department will be pre-approving your details. Then they will be processing your request. Okay. How long does it take? I will be sending you an email in next like 15 minutes. So if you have, after going through, if you have any doubts, you can reply back to that email.

Jorah, how are you? I am good. Thank you so much for asking. Ms. Ahir received an inquiry from Metropolitan Real Estate that you are interested in taking mod gauge. I believe you are looking for a property here. Yeah. Yes, yeah. Yeah? Okay, all right. So I just quickly wanted to know, have you already finalized the property over here or you are still looking for the options out? Still looking for options. Still looking, okay. Are you already aware that UAE government, UAE banks, provide only 50% or 60% of mod gauge to the non-residents? Oh, okay. If you are planning to buy a property over here, 40% of the down payment or 50% of the payment has to be done from your side only. Oh, okay. The amount which they given from bank to you. Oh, so I have to have, because I said I don't have the down payment. What is the balance? It's not about this thing, what you call a resident and a non-resident has a difference. Like a person who is a resident over here will get up to 80%. A person who is not a resident will get up to 60. 60 is the max you get or 50 is the most of the banks which they are giving. The less has to be paid by the client on their own. Okay. Okay, the best I'm saying, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have, thanks. I don't have that much. Say for example, if you are taking a property worth 1 million, 1 million dirham in Dubai. 500,000 has to be from your side and 500 will be given by bank. Whatever the property value you are taking, half has to come from your side. Yeah, I don't have that much. Okay, so we are dropping the plan. Can you find me like something that I can afford? Can you just give me an idea like how much you want to invest and how much you have? I don't have anything. I just want to, like if I go there and I become a resident, yeah. And I just want to know how much. I mean, well, like I'm Canadian citizen. So if I go there and I become a resident. There are ways to become a resident, either to have your own company, to open your own company and have investors visa and get your residency. Either you invest in a property over here and you get investors visa for two years or golden visa for 10 years if you have 2 million dirham for your property. And you can come here and find a job. They will also give you a residency visa for two years and you will be a resident of Dubai then. Okay. Yes. I don't know what to, how do I open a company over there like my first time. You are going to come to Dubai and see the market and have a look how do things over there. And then take a call. Okay. I don't. Well, can you call me later? Maybe let me think it through. But like, how cheap are the, what's the cheapest property there? I'm sorry. Oh, you're breaking up. Sorry. I'm sorry. You're breaking up. I can't hear you. I'm sorry.\",\n",

I am calling to charge the mortgage assistance as we receive your details from, you know, Revolve Reality. Yes, yes, yes. So, it's mentioned that you are looking for, you know, mortgage assistance. So, I am just calling you to pre-qualify, you know, pre-screening first. So, once it is done, I can put you across with the mortgage advisor. So, I just need a few details to understand what type of property you're looking for and what is your current salary. Okay, I'll tell you. I have already seen a property which I am taking and I have done the booking. So, it isn't by land and the handover is in October 2023. The building is 95% completely ready. It's there. The last things are going on. October 2023? Yeah. Now I need the mortgage on that, like 20% I have, 80% mortgage I need. So, what can be done? Okay, let me explain you. There are two options. One is for off plan, one is for ready to move in. So, the property which you're looking for is off plan property. So, still it's not 100% completed. You don't have the title date in hand. It means it's considered as off plan. So, as per the off plan properties in UAE, the banks can give only 50% of the mortgage value. If you have ready to move in 100% completed, if you have a title date in hand, then it means you can get up to 80% of the property value. Okay. So, as you mentioned, you have already 20% in hand and you are looking for 80%. Yeah. So, for that you need to wait till the property is hand over and then you get the title date and only you can request for 80%. Okay. Even if we say if I put 30% from my size, 70% I am looking for, so that is not possible right now. No madam, still it is not because only 50%, up to 50% that is also not full 50% based on your DBR. Okay. So, in case if you want to go for 80% then you need to wait till the construction is completed. But you guys can go do the valuation and everything, the building is already there, it's almost done. No, I understand that. So, for that we have a dedicated application where you can check any property hand over stage. So, only we can consider 100% when you have a title date in hand. Okay. Because when we are processing the loan, we need a title date document as one of the documents to process your application. So, 50% you can do right now? Yeah, up to 50%. Up to 50% okay. And how many days does it take to get it done? No, right now I am just getting few details, that's a pre-screening process. Then I can forward your details to ModGageAdvisor who will be contacting you on next working day. He will be the right person to give you the details about interest rate, what is the maximum amount you can go for all the details. Once you are okay to proceed further, the other one who will be processing your request. Okay. So, if you want I can just take down few details I can put you across if you are okay to go ahead with 50%. Yeah, yeah please. So, you are resident in UAE or non-resident? Resident. And you are salary-read or self-employed? Salary-read. And you are current salary right now? It's 20,000 plus. Make it the exact or can I mention 20? You can mention 20,000 monthly. 23. Okay. How long you have been working with the company? It's been like, I can't tell you all the details but... Approximately one year, two years, three years. You can take as of two, three years. Okay, I consider us two years and may I know your age please? 33. Okay. And do you have any liabilities in UAE? Any credit card, personal loan or total loan? Not at all. No. Okay. And may I know your nationality please? Indian. Okay. And the property you are looking for off-plan and the price of the property please? The price of the property is 7,000,000. 700,000? 700,000. Okay. And is it your first property in UAE? Yeah. Okay. And you said like by October? Yeah, October 23, India. Okay. Thank you so much for the details. I'll put you across with the mortgage advisor. I'll share these details to them. You can expect the call back from them by next working day because as you know due to the holidays. So either Monday or Tuesday you can get a call back from them.

So is this salary coming in your bank account or through cash? Well, I clearly mentioned the Quebec still don't have my MRT ID with me. I can still apply for bank account. So I've been receiving cash. Okay, because what happens is once your bank, once your visa is processed, once you have your MRT ID, once you have your bank account set up, you should have one salary transferred. So only then you can apply for the mortgage. So what I can do, I can just give you a call maybe after two or three months and then we can definitely check. Okay? Yeah, if you call me next month because now my MRT ID is going to be ready in the next two weeks or so. Wonderful. I will open an account and then they can transfer the salary. Sure.

I want credit card here. What is the limit on the card? 15,000. So only one credit card you have, right? Yes. Okay, perfect. So that's all for now. The property, project name, by any chance have you already finalized what property are you working on? I was searching but then I found that it's not in the case. So it may take some time. I don't want to be in the rush to come out. This is my future. So I will take some time. If you are, I agree. So then I will check and we will decide that. No problem. So one of my mortgage experts will get back to you in next 48 hours maximum and they will assist you with the approval from the bank. Yeah, but no problem. Last time I can't buy, right? Sorry, come again. Saying like any, I can apply. No problem for the, like there is no limit in one. The bank's approval will be valid for 90 days. So you can, you can apply with no problem. You can apply within that time. Even this bank approval we can delay, right? Let me just finish with the selection then we can take approval. Meanwhile, you can check your approval details. Once you the approval details are with you, you can finally decide when are you going to purchase. So you can, you know, you will have an idea that this is the amount you will be able to. If three months are like less than what will happen like we will have to go again for approval. Or it will be more difficult. We can retrieve the new approval then. But see if you are applying right now and it gets rejected. So you will have an idea that if it is getting approved, what will be the interest rate, what will be the amount you will be eligible for or the tenure. So you know, you will have those basic details. So that's the reason we are. Maximum is 25 years, right? Maximum is 25 years, yes. Thank you. Okay, thank you Mr. Sahir. Bye-bye.\",\n",

Yeah, the first property in Dubai. Okay. All right. Thank you so much for the information. My mortgage advisor will give you a call tomorrow morning. They will ask for certain documents and get you the pre-approval from different banks in Dubai because we have tie-ups with top-notch banks and we will get you a rate and then you will have a choice to select with which bank with which bank you will prefer to go with. Yeah. Yeah. And you asked me how long I have been with this current company. Is that a requirement? Because some people, they change jobs. Whereas they have the salary which we can take, but they change the jobs. Then when we ask for three-month bank statement, it should be from the same company and the resignation should match. So once there is one month is missing and then they say we have changed the job but the salary is more, then we have to get the NOC from their HR that this employee is the permanent employee. Yeah, for that reason we have to ask. Yeah, but because the project has been delayed by more than one year, say two years and of course I will change jobs. So I am in a job change phase. So yeah, I don't know when the pre-approval happens. Pre-approval will happen probably in a week or lesser than that. It depends upon your profile. Yeah, I am meeting two banks this week for pre-approval. So I will get that done. So yeah, of course, only thing is I am just saying that of course a guy or a person changes jobs. I know, I know. Yeah, that is the reason we have to ask because then for that person who has changed the job we have to again wait for the three months so that we can get the new three month bank statement from the new company. Yeah, all right. All right. As of now it is all available. So yeah, just check with your mod supervisor. Yeah, then let me know. Okay, all right. Thank you for the information. Have a lovely day.

We're looking for a two-bedroom apartment and your budget is around 800,000. Is that correct? Yeah, a little less than 800,000. 800,000 is like the maximum that I can go, but then I would rather prefer 700,000 or somewhere near about. No problem. And have you already finalized the property or are you still looking out for options? No, no, no. I, in fact, we are looking for something that we will be able to finalize in the next four or five months or so, because we are still in a contract, in a rented apartment. Okay. And that contract ends in September. Okay. So what we would like to move out. Okay, no problem. Now, what we do is we assist for ModGage. We have contracts in place with all the major banks in the UAE. We don't charge you any because we work for the banks and we also have ties with real estate companies who give us references. Okay. We have references from footprint real estate. Now, what I can do is we can do a pre-screening for you, where we can take your eligibility with the banks that we work for and then we will give you a counter offer for the ModGage. Okay. If you don't mind, I have a few questions to understand your profile. Absolutely. Okay. Can you tell me your passport I believe is from India. Is that correct? Correct. Okay. How long have you been UAE resident? It will be one year in September. One year. Okay. And this is going to be your first property in the UAE? Yes. Okay. Can I know your age please? I will be 52 right now. 51 actually, 52 this November. Okay. Are you buying the property alone or do you have a co-applicant? Alone. Alone. Okay. And you already told me the budget is 700,000. I'll mention that. Okay. Now, are you comfortable paying the 20% down payment? I should be able to, but is there a counter another way to tackle that? Yes, I was going to explain to you. So, ModGage is always 80% maximum. Okay. There's no two ways about it. However, if there are any clients who are not comfortable with the 20% down payment, what we do is from the same bank, we assist you with a small amount through a personal loan. Okay. So, you have two loans, two separate installments, only if you require that. Otherwise, 20% down payment is mandatory because there's no two ways about it. It's only UAE nations who have up to 100% finance from the bank. Understood. So, I'll mention that for you. In case you want to think about it, you can let us know later, but I'll mention that you're okay with 20% down payment for now. If I'm still required, we will help you with that as well. Yeah. Okay. Are you salaried over here or self-employed? Salaried. And your current job tenure at this firm is one year or is it more than that? I mean, if you look at the UAE branch, yeah, I joined 2022, but I've been working with the company for the past seven, eight years now. It's a transfer from one country to the other. Yeah. I was previously, I was in Shanghai and now I'm here. With the same company, right? With the same branch of group of schools. Okay. And the property that you will buy, is it going to be under construction or ready to move in? I would prefer ready to move in, but it depends. Yeah. The reason I'm asking, because for under construction, you will not be able to get the loan immediately. The property construction is 90% complete. The mortgage cannot be done because the bank does not get to value or do a valuation for the property in that case. Okay. So we prefer that you buy ready to move in so that the process for the mortgage is done quickly. Otherwise, it takes a lot of time. I understood. And do you have any loan from any bank? Personal loan, car loan? No. Okay. And can I know how much is your salary? Per month. Yes. Roughly around 1700, I mean, 17,000. Okay. And that's your fixed salary, right? No variables or allowances included. No, no. Your six months bank statement will show the same salary. Yeah. Okay. No car loan, personal loan? None. Credit card? Yes, I do have a credit card. Okay. Can you tell me roughly what is the total limit for all the cards anyway? I think it is 25,000 for each just DC. Only one card? Only one card. Okay. Now I don't see any problem in your eligibility as for the pre-screening. I think you're eligible for a higher amount as well, but we'll not push you for it. Whatever you decide, we can proceed with that. Okay. I will be putting your request to our mortgage specialist team. Someone will call you after checking your profile with the banks and then we'll tell you which bank is giving you the best offer. If you want, you can take two, three options as well. We can give you multiple options from the banks as well. Okay. Right? You get a call within next today's Saturday. You'll get a call on Monday morning. Could it be in the Monday evening because at school I don't pick my phone? No problem. If you don't answer, we'll send you a message. I have already checked. You don't have WhatsApp on this number. Would you like to give your WhatsApp number so that we can send you a message? Yeah, okay. Or do you want us to send you an SMS or something? An SMS is better. My WhatsApp is still on my China number. No problem. So I'll ask the team to contact you where SMS in case you're not able to answer the call, then you can get in touch with the person. And I'll also mention that you're comfortable speaking in the evening. Yes. All right. So you get a call from Pripko. My company name is Pripko. Okay. Okay. Thank you for your time. Have a good day. Bye-bye. Bye.\",\n",

Lately we've sort of been changing our approach. So because the thing is on the property value of 2.9 we spoke to other people and 20% deposit plus the other fees actually added up to 27%. Yeah, 20% you have to do a deposit and up to 80% you can get the mortgage. Yes, but then the fees and Dubai land department and everything that all the additional fees added up to 27% upfront. Is that about right? Yeah. Okay, so that was too much. The fees were ridiculous. So we're looking for something smaller now. So let's say about 2 million. Okay, so how much loan you're looking for like the 80% of the total amount, right? Yes. Okay, the thing is that once you get the loan once you get the pre-approval you will have only having a 30 days to finalize your property. Yeah, okay. So can we negotiate with sellers if we don't have the pre-approval? I will tell you sir how it works. Just look for a property like where you want to go for it. Okay, then wait for the loan, how much loan you're going to get it. Okay, for example you got some 75% 80% whatever loan you bought. Then you can go to the developer and just tell them I want this property. You pay the 20% and the deposit will be there for you because you're having a 30 days. Okay, yes, but do I need to have a pre-approval in place or can I go to the seller and say... You can directly go to the seller as well. Before we have the pre-approval. Yes, you can do that. Okay, alright. You can do that as well. Another question is can we get a property that's worth 1.8 million, can we take out a mortgage of 2 million to cover renovation costs? No. No, then you have to take the personal loan. That is for your personal loan, that can't be as a personal loan, it can't be. Okay, then also do you offer something that you want to the offset loan? Sorry? Offset? No, we don't offer it. So who do you deal with in terms of banks or... We deal with the banks, we have a tie with all the banks. What we'll do, we'll take all the information from the customer, we'll give to the various banks. Okay, the banks come us back and just tell them from this we can give you, we can give you this interest rate on this, you're going to get it. So it's very easy for the customer to say it's in this, you're saving your time. There is no effect in your bureau score. Like if you're going for the different different banks, they will pull your bureau. The score will go down. Sorry, no, yes. If you're going directly to the bank, you don't know what is the other banks are approaching. But in this, we have a tie with all the banks, they can give you the interest rate from the different banks, whatever you can get it. Okay, yeah. So that is a good option in this. At this, going to be your first property in UAE, right? Yes. Okay. And when you're planning to buy this property? Well, soon. With the, we can say ASAP? Yes, I think so, yeah. Okay. Okay, so what I will do, I will just send the leaders to the market advisor. They're going to give you a call and they will give you the all the information. Okay, so then, okay, so that someone was in your company? Yeah, someone from my company, the mortgage advisor, from the end of service, everything he's going to do it, you don't need to go to the bank, you don't need to do anything. So whatever he do, he will ask you the document, he's going to do it. So one source person will be there. You can call him anytime, you can ask him if you have any doubt, you can ask that guy else. Okay, because I want you to just find out as well what the options are in terms of loans. But also, you know, interest rates, and also options such as offset loan, where we can keep money in the mortgage account and have access to it, but where it reduces the interest payable. Yeah, so everything he will give the all the information he's going to give it to you, so. Okay, so just a few of them, a few options. Yeah, everything he's going to give you and he's going to let you know from which bank, how much you're going to get it, from this bank, how much you're going to get it, he will give you the all the information. So he will also look at the options of offset loan and things like that. Everything he will give you the information for it. Okay, alright. So I'm just sending a details he will give you a call back. Okay, thank you so much. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. Bye bye. You too, bye.\",\n",

So may I know if you have already finalized the property or you're still looking out? We're still looking out. Perfect. And the budget. Before we proceed, I just wanted to know you got my contact from, what is it, what is your name? Very ready to get my contact. It's classic properties from Karan Bang. Classic properties. Okay, yeah, that's the one. Okay, thank you. No problem. Sorry, tell me. No problem, no problem. So I will require a few details before we check your eligibility for the mortgage. We have a tie up with all the banks in UAE. So, you know, we will check the best offer available for you. And then the one of the mortgage export will get back to you for the next 48 hours. Okay, fine. Do you have any charges from your side for this service? No, no, we don't. It's a free off charge. Okay, fine. So can I know if you're a resident here in UAE or non-resident? A resident. Sure. And how long have you been in the country? I was born about a year, so I would say 30 years. So, 30, right? 30 years. Perfect. And how, your age is 30 years as well, right? 31, yeah. Okay, 31, perfect. So, your salary, or are you like working or you own a company in UAE? Salary, yeah. Okay, and what's your current salary? 17,000, that's 17. 17, this is the fixed salary, right? Apart from this, if you have any additional income, we can consider that as well. No, no, this is the only income that is there. There is no commission or anything like that. Perfect, okay. So, your duration in the company as in your length of service, how long have you been working here? I'll be completing 10 years this June. You'll be completing 10 years this June, so about like 9.8, 9.9 years, right? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Perfect. I still mention your 10 years because it's only a matter of two, three months, so it's fine. Correct. Any active liabilities in UAE? Let's say if you have any credit cards, a personal loan, the auto loans? No loans as such. This is the normal credit card, but I just use them for like groceries and stuff like that. And I pay them monthly, so nothing has a liability as such. Okay, I understand that. And how much is your credit limit on the, total credit limit on the cards? So, there are two cards. I have one which is 74 and the other one is 24. So, exactly 100,000. Yeah. Perfect. And any other personal loans or auto loans apart from that? No, nothing at all. Nothing at all? Nothing at all. And okay, you're Indian, right? You're from India? Yes. Yes. Okay. The property we are looking forward to is, will it be a ready to move in or an off plan? Ready to move in. And anything in your mind as in any location or any property which you, you know, you are still like, not finalized, but still looking at in the sense that it is. Yeah, currently the, yeah, the current one that we are looking at is in Rimram. Rimram and this is a villa or an apartment? It's an apartment, one bedroom apartment. One BHK apartment. And what's the project name? Rimram. R-E-M. R-A-A-M. Okay. Is it like the area name is Rimram, right? Yeah, the area name is that, yeah. The developers will be, I think, will be different. I think it is Dubai properties, but I'll have to check with my agent for that. No problem. It's fine. I've still got the few information, so it's absolutely fine. And there will be a 20% payment which client, I mean, which once you are finalizing the property, you will have to go ahead and make, because the mortgage will only be 80% of the amount. So I hope you're aware about that and you will have to make a decision on that. Do you cover any of the other costs apart from the cost of the house? It depends on banks to banks. Okay. So basically, if the particular bank, you know, giving you such an offer, where they can cover more things, the mortgage advisor will definitely give an update to you and you can decide accordingly. Okay. This is going to be your first property in UA? Or do you already have another? Okay, this is my first one. And what is the amount, the property value? Currently, 500,000 is what I've been told, but we are negotiating as well with the seller. So I would say for now, just take 500,000. Perfect. I have noted that. So yeah, so far, everything seems to be fine. All your details are recorded and I'll be just sending out, you know, the details. I'll pass it on to my colleague in the mortgage department. They will get back to you once they will evaluate the best offer for you available. So they'll take it on with a couple of banks and they'll get back to you. Yes, exactly. So you can be available on the same number, right? After 40 years. Yes. Perfect. Thank you for your time and have a great day ahead. Bye-bye. You too.\",\n",

How are you? I am good. Thank you so much for asking. It's regarding mortgage. I have received an inquiry from Metropolitan Real Estate. That you are interested in taking mortgage for the property. Is that correct? That's right. Okay. All right. Ms. Linda, are you aware that UAE banks only give 50% or 60% max to the non-residents? No, I didn't know. Okay. How much you were... I was told yesterday. So you were told that you were given half of it, right? Yeah. Okay. All right. So whatever the total value of your property is going to be, you will be either giving up to 60% of that or up to 50% rest has to be paid from your side. Shall we take it forward? I don't understand what you mean by... Yeah, I'll tell you. So I have to come up with half payment. But can that be done like monthly payments? See, I'll tell you how does it work. Say for example, your property value is 1 million that I'm overhead. Okay. You will get 600,000 or 500,000 max from the bank based on your profile. Okay. Rest has to be paid from your side only.

May I know what's an personality? I'll start off again. Okay. So, I've got the card. Okay. And are you looking for the offline or are you looking for ready to move in? No, ready to move in. Okay. Ready to move in. And may I know, like, how much loan you're looking for? The maximum amount that I can get. Maximum. Like, the 20% you have to do a down payment. Yes. And rest up to 80% you can get the mortgage, okay? Yeah. Yeah. And, like, this will be your first property in your area, right? Yes. Okay. Do you finalize any property or are you still looking for the property? No. I'm actually still speaking with her. We're waiting to get a viewing of the apartment. Okay. So, I also told her, like, I literally just started looking for mortgages. I started with my bank, obviously. But I, like, you know, I'm still researching as to what's the best rates and so, when you said that I would get a call from someone would kind of explain to me the rates of different banks and I would choose the best possible. Okay. What we does, okay, the good advantage for what we does, we have a tie with the various banks, okay? This information will go to the various banks. The bank will come back to us. They will tell us from this bank, we are giving it this. On this bank, you get this. The good thing about UMA, you have the, you know, you're working for MS Airlines, MS Airlines mostly listed with all the banks. Yeah. So, that is a good advantage for you as well. And with the listed companies, you will get less interest rates. So, they can let you know the all interest rate and you don't need to go to the any, no different agent. So, you're only one person who can assign to you and he will let you know the, with the all the banks and he will be the one who will touch with the banks. You don't need to talk to your call with the banks and all that. He will do all the people for you. Okay. Can I also ask you something, Harvind, that my husband, his company also listed and he just left the country today to go on vacation. Would you be able to check for him as well? Yeah, you can also both, you can also both together, you can also apply for it with a corp, you can also do that. So, what's going to happen with that? In this, the case will be get more stronger. Like there are more higher chances you can get more. I think that will be better. Yeah. Okay. So, I will take your husband information as well. Just kidding. Okay. And when you're planning to buy a property, can you tell me the, because, We were hoping to do it within the next three months or so. Okay. Why I'm asking you. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry to interrupt you. Why I'm asking you because once you get the pre-Apple rule, you are only having a one month to finalize the property. Okay. I see. I thought it was two months. They allow you. Different banks. Like different banks, you can get before two months, but the different bank, you will only having one month. So, depends from which bank are you going for it. But, you know, if you're not able to do that, they finalize the property within a one month and again, you will, you have to go with this start. Okay. So, get the approval again, pre-approval again. Yes. Yes. I see. Okay. So, can you tell me your husband like this? He's a resident in U.E.? Yes, he is. But just one more question before we go with this information. So, I just want to understand something, right? This process that you're doing, that you're going to do for us is you're going to get different rates from the different banks that's going to, then you can present that to me. Okay. So, this is the point. There's nothing that's actual, only once I agree, then we obviously start to approve it. Yes, yes, yes. Then once you sign the paper, then only. Then from that point, it's one month, right? No, no, no. I will tell you how it works. Yeah. These details, just the mortgage advisor will see. Okay. Yeah. After that, what will happen, they will, the mortgage advisor will ask you the KYC documents to check your bureau scores. Yeah. The bureau scores will go to the different banks. Yeah. And they will finalize as per your score, as per the current offer, you will get that interest rate. Okay. Okay. To get the interest rate, you will having only one month. Okay. On that interest rate. Yeah. Then next month, again, you have to keep the, again, the KYC will go to the bank. What's going to be a current rate? Yeah. You will have to check the life score. Then again, they will go to the life score and again, they will go to the various bank that whatever the offer is going to be on that time, that you're going to get it. Right. I see. I see. Because I believe my test score is like 789. That's very nice. Yeah. I believe that's good. Yeah. So apply for again and again, the score will go down. That is a only, that is also issue. So that's why when we, when we do actually apply, we need to be hand-to-hand with them and ensure that we are, we found the property that we're going to go for. Yes. Otherwise, this is delaying on it. Yeah. It's going to go lower and lower. Yeah. And it's kind of like this credibility, credibility as to whether we want to. Yeah. Because, yeah. So what I can suggest to you, let's go for it first. Let's just see what you, what you exact, what max you're getting. Okay. Right. So what you're going to do is you're going to have to do it within a month or like 40 days or up to 60 days, whichever bank you're going, going to. So at least you will having an idea like, you know, Yeah. That is what I kind of really want right now. An idea, because actually we have to give our landlord by the end of this week, whether we can extend for six more months or not. But our actual rent, at least ends in June. So April, May, June to decide whether we want to buy or not, but he actually wants an answer by the end of this week. Okay. So, so what I can do that on the Monday, I can tell the guy to give you a call. Okay. Just try to give him the document as soon as like, you know, on the same day or next day. So what he will do, he can try to reply on Monday or like in Tuesday or a Wednesday. So you will get an idea. This maximum I can get it. I can go or not with the mortgage because what I can say, as you said, you have a good score as well as you have a 17,000 you have a 60,000 limit. Or if you do like if few cars, if you're not using it, you can be ready to cancel those cars as well. So and your husband also, I believe you're having a more than 10,000 salary. So you can get a good amount of mortgage, man. Yeah, you can get that like 80, 80% or 70, 75% you can get the mortgage. Okay. Yeah, let me go ahead and give you his details. Yeah. Okay. What's your husband age? He studies. He will be 34 as well. 34 and he is a self employed or he's having his own. He works for somebody called Calma. KALMAR. Calma working. Calma company. Okay. All right. Calma. And may know salary. How much salary has been sold here on 25,000. Okay. And since like how long he's working in the same company, he's been working this since 2020. 2020? Yes. He started, yeah, he was working for another company before that. Calma, he was 2020. Yeah. Okay. And how many trade cards your husband has? He has one credit card. Okay. What is the limit? You know the limit? No, unfortunately, I don't know it. It's an entity card. Okay. And any loan, mortgage loan, car loan. He has a loan. He's got a loan. Puzzle loan? Yes, the Puzzle loan. Okay. How much he's paying for it? I think about 3000 there. How's the month? Okay. Okay. Do you have any auto loan? No, he's got no auto loan. No auto loan. Okay. Nationality? South African. South African. Okay. And you're looking for the like a claim that are ready to move in. Yeah. Okay. So what I can suggest to you, like you both can apply for it, man. It's 25,000. It's a good salary and 17,000. If you apply for all together, you can get the good rates, you know. So what I will do, I will just send the board details to the mortgage advisor. So I'll just tell him to give you a call on Monday. Monday, what for the convenient time I can tell the mortgage advisor? Let me look at my roster. Are you cabin crew? Like you're a cabin crew? Yeah. Oh, okay. Is that a problem? No, no, no, no, I'm just sorry. Because mostly they fly to different different countries, you know, that they are very hard to connect with them. Yeah, it is. I'm sorry. Yeah. Monday, Monday, preferably in the morning, if you could call. Monday more. But please, Monday more. First, because I told you like I don't answer. Random call. If you could just send me a message first, I'll be perfect. Okay. Please. Please send the message before you call. Okay. Okay. I will tell them like Monday what time to what time to what time you're going to. So like any time in the morning before 12. Before 12, 8 to 12. Yeah. Yes. Okay. I will tell the mortgage advisor to give you a call before 12. Okay. Okay. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you so much for giving the time ma'am. Have a nice day. Bye. Bye.\",\n",

Basically, we're looking to buy a house for my family. Probably from the secondary market, given that I'm looking for something to move rather soon and not wait for years until it's ready. So yes, I'm looking for finance for part of the price, obviously. Sure. So how much is the property value that you're looking at? Well, I'm looking at by no more than three million. I don't want to spend any more. So probably this is the price change you will take. Okay. And is it ready to move in property? As I said, it's probably going to be the secondary market already to move in property. There's nothing particular which I'm looking because as Yogesh explained to me, you better get pre-approval and then start looking once you know how much money you have at your disposal. Yes. I got it. I got it. So you will be taking the property under your name and you're looking mortgage under your name, right? Yes. I assume, assuming it possible, I will write the house of my wife's name as well. I assume there's no issues with that. There won't be any issues basically.

If I do nothing, that's what it would be. All right. And let's say as you are having this business, may I know the nature of your business, please? Yes, of course. But professional, I'm a lawyer and a fully certified public accountant. So basically most of the things I do are either like legal advice or service like C4 or C4 for all kinds of organizations that provide legal advice, tax advice, business development, these kinds of professional advice.

I'm fine sir. Thank you Mr. Anuj. I'm calling in regards to mortgage assistance as we receive your details from Metropolitan. Oh yeah. Yeah. So are you still looking out for the property or you have to finalize any property? No. I have to finalize. It all depends on if I can get the funds somehow. So let's see what best I can do. Let me check the details. Sure. So can you help me with few information which is like your salary or self-employed? No, no, I'm salary. Salary. Yeah. Okay. Final. Final. Final. Final. And what is your current salary right now? So my salary is 20K per month. 20K. Great. And how long have you been working? So. Okay. So last year only I changed my company but in UAE I worked for 5 years. Okay. So you want to take us a joint venture like both together or like only one person under union because as per I can see the 20,000 is fine because minimum requirement is 10,000. Okay. No, joint venture is fine but the thing is she's not like a salary person. She's freelancing. She's freelancing. Oh, okay. Then not possible. Only we can take under your name. So I wanted to confirm 20,000 is your salary. How long have you been working one year? Yeah. With the same company. Yes. Okay. And you're resident in UAE and may know your age please? 31. 31. May know your liabilities please? If you have any in UAE like credit cards, personal loan, loan card. What is the total limit of the cards? It is 38,000. 38,000 altogether. Yeah. Okay. I have only one card. Okay. And your nationality please? Indian. Okay. And the property which you're looking for it's ready to move in or off plan? Off plan. Off plan. Okay. All right. And what is the price of the property you're looking for? 1.7 million. 1.7 million. Okay. Yeah. And this is your first property in UAE? Yes. Okay. What is the rate of purchase will be as soon as possible once you get. Okay. Let me give you some information about this off plan since you have selected off plan. So you can take only maximum up to 50% of the property value if you're going for the off plan. Okay. If you're going for ready to move in. Okay. So the property also should be completed at least 50% for the off plan more than 50% to get the value of between 50 to 80% you can get it. Okay. That is based on the house how much of the property is completed. Okay. Okay. That I am not sure. But if you're going for ready to move in property then you can get up to 80% of the property value. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So I have actually two properties in mind. Okay. One is I mean both of them are off plan but the first one which I am talking about it's ready. It's I think 90% ready because the handover is in the end of July. Okay. So that is almost ready. The other one which I am talking about that is that is actually completing after three years. Three years. Okay. I don't think so it will be 50% ready. Then you can go for the first option which you mentioned which is the handover in few days I mean few months. So you can go for that you can get between 50 to 80% of the property value as mortgage and reminding you have to pay as a down payment reminding value. But what I can do is since you have given these details I can put you across with one of the mortgage advisor who will be contacting you shortly by tomorrow's also you can expect to call back by Monday from the team and they can give you the information they will ask you for few documents and they will have a word with the banks all the banks in the UAE whichever is connected with and they will give you the best offer. You can decide which one you like to go for based on your decision then we will proceed according. Okay. No but I have one question here. So the property is off plan right. So you can give me this mortgage or 50 to 80% value only after the handover right. No no no. In between that also you can yes this will be the reason being I will tell you the story behind it. Let me stop you there why I am giving you an information that I will put you across with the mortgage advisor because we are not the right person to discuss about these things even we are not having exact clarity on this because if I say something later on they will say something else but surely when you get a call if you have any doubts clarification do let them know because they are the only person who will be getting this done till you get the mortgage in hand. The same person will be helping you out. Okay. So I would like to please wait for a day or two so that you can get a call back from the team and they will assist you on that. Okay no problem. Can you just put a note there if they can call me after four o'clock because I can put the note. Okay. No issue even they will drop you a message in WhatsApp in case if you missed a call they will be in touch with you. They will follow up with you. Okay. Okay. Anything else I may help you with Mr. Nutsch. No not at the time. Thank you. Thank you sir. Thank you for your time sir. Have a good day. You too. Bye.\",\n",

       "  'content': {'text': \" Hello. Hello, hi, good afternoon. Can I speak to Mr. Sam? Yes, speaking. Mr. Sam, this is Yassin calling from Pripco. I'm calling you from Dubai in regards to mortgage assistance. So we receive the details from stating that you're looking for purchasing a property in UAE and you're looking for mortgage assistance. So I'd just like to take a few details of yours to check the eligibility so I can put you across with one of the mortgage advisor to her in the call back. Okay, why is that? Okay, so as I can see that as for the comments, it's mentioned you are living in Canada and so it means like you are a non-resident. And I wanted to know have you finalized any properties or still looking out in UAE? Numbers. Search numbers. Still searching. And is it ready to move in property or off plan? What type of property are you looking for? Sorry, what kind of property? It's ready to move in which is like 100% constructed or off plan which is under construction. Ready to move in. Okay. And may know like what is the price of the property approximately, the budget which you have for? 800,000. 800,000. Didn't. That's fair. Yeah. Okay, in EED. And may know like are you salary or self employed? Self employed. Self employed. Okay. And may know what is your last year turnover? What do you mean by that? Your company turnover last year to check the salary part? Revenue. Yes. 180,000. How much is 100? 180,000. 80,000 dirhams or dollars. 180,000. 180,000. 180,000. 180,000. 180,000. 180,000. 180,000. How long you are running the business? 10 years. 10 years. Okay. Do you hold any liabilities in UAE in any of the banks like credit card, personal loan or to loan? No. And may know your nationality please? NUAN. NUAN. Okay. This is your first property in UAE? Yeah. Okay. And may know your age please? 41. 41. Okay. Thank you so much for the details. And you will be getting confirmation call like you know from R and I will be assigning a mortgage advisor with these details and you will be getting a call from the mortgage advisor either today or Monday and they will help you in providing the details about like how much you can get. And usually since you are a non-resident which you can get like 50% of the property value as a mortgage. Let's say you say like your budget is 800 so you can get up to 400,000 as a mortgage loan from the banks and 400 you have to pay it from your pocket. And apart from that. What is your residence? Sorry I didn't understand that question. It's from a residence for example. Okay. If it is a resident then you can get up to 80%. What if I get residences? I think it's like 2000 dollars. Residence in the sense like if you are working in UAE and you are having an Emirates ID then you will be considered as resident in UAE. And then if you are applying for that then based on the salary we can get up to 80% of your property value. If you are working in a country that is a resident in UAE? That will be based on your investments. If you have 2 million dirhams fully paid you can get a golden visa which will be for 10 years. Yeah, but the residency you can choose by residency. It can affect 2000 dollars. No, I'm not aware of it but for the visa services I would recommend you to be in check with any of the specific travel agencies who will help you with that. But right now after the UAE bank loss if you have a residency in UAE you can get 80% of the property value. And if you are non-resident you can get up to 50% or sometimes it's based on the document subject approval you can get up to maximum of 75%. So the visa service will be subject to approval. Yeah, so I cannot confirm. I'm not sure about those documents. But as per my knowledge 50 is the one which we are giving. But sometimes based on like if the bank have a specific qualification I'm not sure that you can check with the mortgage advisor which I'm assigning to you so that he will be giving you the update. If there is any possibility based on your documents he will let you know if it can be increased or not. But 50 is the one like a basic which can be provided. So I will forward this details. You will be getting a call as soon as possible from the team and who can help in getting the information about the mortgage. Are they able to communicate via email? Email or WhatsApp? Do you have WhatsApp number? The same number? Yeah, same number. I will mention that in case if you are not reachable I will ask them to drop a WhatsApp message so you can be interested with them through WhatsApp. Even in the later hours they can assist you on that. Exactly. Okay, anything else I may have to say? That's okay. Thank you. What's your company name? Prypco. The name of the company is Prypco, a PropTech platform for real estate services. P-I-P-C-R-O-M-A-T. It's P for Papa. Yeah. Or Y, Romeo Yankee. Right. And Papa, Charlie Oscar. Okay, Prypco. Yeah. Okay, you guys provide only more visas, right? We do help with the mortgage and we do help with the golden visas in case if you have two million dirhams or more fully paid on any of the property or any investment then you can go for the golden visa. We can assist that as well. Fully paid as well. Fully paid two million dirhams. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for your time Mr. Sam. Have a good day. Okay.\",\n",

And is it the six salary that you are coming every month to your cart, or do you have any commissions or some kind of like annuling commissions? No, that's just into my bank. It's 6,215 each month. Okay. And by any chance, you don't have any like, business income, let's say from your country or? No. Okay. May I know, how long you've been working with this company, just last August, August, or? Yeah. Okay. Do you have any liabilities, such a car loan, personal loan? No. Okay. What about the credit cards? Do you have any? And if yes, what? Yes. Okay. May I know what the total limit? It's 18,000 something. I'm not sure, only odd. Okay. Are you using that? Yes. Okay. May I know what's your nationality from which country are you? British. British. Okay. And the property that you're looking for, is it going to be ready to move in or off plan? Ready to move in. Okay. Ready to move in. And the property that you're looking for is, I mean, like you're still looking for options, you still didn't finalize any property or is it already a short list? No, we haven't finalized any property. We're just looking at the moment to see what. Okay. All the options are really is just trying to figure it all out and see what everything is. Okay. That's not a problem. And your budget is like up to one million, right? I have no idea. So like the price of the property that you're looking for is going to be like up to one million, but not about up to up. Yeah. It was, I think it was up to about 900,000. Okay. Okay. And I assume it's going to be a first property in Dubai? Yes. And when you would like to purchase it like as soon as possible or you're not in a rush like within one to months? We're not in a rush. Okay. So what's that promise time? Like because the pre-approval from the bank is going to be valid for two months maximum. Okay. So what should I put like the promise date? Yeah. If two months from today? Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I just wanted to clarify Mr. Stefan one more time. So your salary per month is 6,000. Yeah. No, not more. No. Okay. So you see we have like, yeah. Sorry. I was just going to say. My wife is a teacher and serious salaries a lot more than mine. Would that be better? Okay. Yeah. We can take a mortgage under your wife's name or even better. Like we can go with the options that you can apply together. Okay. So we can like combine your salary and her salary. So it will be higher chance since you will get like best offer from the banks. Okay. Yeah. Can you also give me the whole information that I just like ask you? Can you answer all the questions about her? Yeah. So her salary is 17,500. Okay. And she's a resident. Yeah. She's a resident from August as well. Okay. Her age? 36. 36. Okay. And okay. So she's a celebrity as well. Yeah. And she's also working in that company from the last August. Same as you, right? Yes. Okay. Yeah. So she's got a car loan as well. Car loan? Okay. How much is she staying like per month? Sorry. One second. I'll find it out. Yeah. Sure. No way. Yeah. Sure. No way. Okay. And does she have any credit cards? No. Okay. So and she's a British as well, right? Yeah. Okay. Okay. So this is the whole information that I needed from the site. It's really great that you're, you can apply as a husband and wife. Yeah. Because otherwise your salary is less than it's really required. Yeah. Because the minimum the salary for the residents should be like 10,000 or 15,000. So 10,000 actually we could only proceed like with only the one bank. So it's perfectly, it's going to be like more 16,000 so we can request your, send your request to all the major banks. Okay. Yeah. So we will combine. So as I can see like your wife only have like one car alone. So we just like the prices like the value is not so high like the amount of she's spending for that like per month. And yeah. So as I can see you can be eligible for the taken mortgage. You will take like 80% of the like the loan from the banks. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's perfect. So just one question with the car loan, would it be better if we, if we paid the car loan off? The paid off you mean like totally paid for the car loan? Yeah. Yeah. But that'd be better to get a mortgage than. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. If I mean like, if it's possible, yeah, but I mean, you still can proceed with this car loan. It's only one car loan that you have. You don't have any like any other labels such a person alone. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. Thank you for sharing your information. I will forward your request to the mortgage advisor department so they can give you the information regarding the mortgage such as bank rates, terms and conditions. And they will give you a call like on Monday or Tuesday because right now is the weekend. So they're not working. Yeah. Okay. It's fine. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. Thank you very much for your help. Thank you for your time. Have a nice weekend. I knew. Bye-bye. Yeah. Thank you.\",\n",

Purchase price or market price? No purchase price. The one which is on title deed. 1.38. 1.38 million. Okay. And this is the first property in UAE? First property. Perfect. That's pretty much it. Tomorrow, Mr. Yusuf, you will get a call from my mortgage advisor. Okay. I will mention in the additional details that you only require 50% of the mortgage from the UAE bank. Yeah, which is around, I'll give you that amount. Wait, wait, wait. I'll give you the amount. Yes. The amount, please stay with me. And it's payable in... Because there was 15, so what it says, it's my post payment. Okay. I had one this month, which I paid already, 15% okay. And I have another one in November. Okay. Okay. And the amount is around... The amount is around... I'm sorry, we just stay with me. Okay. Yeah, the amount is 205.3. So this is how much you want, yeah? Yeah, 205.... 233. Okay, all right. Okay. That's the remaining, still present. Okay. Okay. Okay. And I wanted on... I wanted the shortest amount of time to be paid out. What's the shortest amount? Okay. Five years, maybe, or I don't know if there is a shorter than five years. Yes, we have an option, some banks give options. And once your case will be given to them, and we will tell you which bank is giving, the shorter period, yeah? Yeah, it has to be Islamic, Sharia. Yeah, Islamic, okay. And I want to open with them a bank account for all my... Islamic loans. Okay. And I want to have a bank account with them. Sponsor to open bank account. And maybe there's another figure that is important, that I rented the apartment for 90,000 a year. Okay. That means that's the additional income. I already put it, you know, your additional income. They will be considering that as an additional income, yeah? Yeah, this is what the apartment is renting right now. I just rented it last month. It finished in December, the apartment. It's in Dubai Creek Harbor, E'Amar, it's an E'Amar project. Oh, Masha'Allah. Okay, I got it. Okay. Okay. In Dubai Creek Harbor, the... And they had a wooded in December and you put it on rent from now, yeah? I put it for sale at first. I don't want to rent. Okay. But I didn't find the number that I wanted. I only got the purchase price amount for it, original price, you know? And I just wanted to tell you the original price, so I rented it. Okay. Nice. You will have an income from that as well. Yeah. They gave you 90K, two checks. Exactly. It's perfect, fine. And then next year, if the price is Gouha, you can put it at 100K. Yeah. Because the contract is one year only. One year only, I know, yeah. And you know, it's a new area because it's a new master plan. Yeah, it's a new area. People are crazy about Creek Harbor. Yeah. So I think, you know... Yeah, the moment it will be... The moment it will be wholly developed, 100K is very less. It will touch heights. Keep in mind. It will go very high. Yeah, but still one bedroom or a studio even. See, there were apartments around... The price is there. Yeah, I'm telling you. You see this downtown Dubai, near Burj Khalifa, even the studio, it's touching heights. So same is going to be with the Creek Harbor. It's going to be massive in coming years. Yeah, inshallah. Okay, all right. Tomorrow, you will get a call from my mortgage advisor. They will give you the best rate and plus they will give you the solution of what you need. Yeah. Islamic, please. Islamic. I put it everything according to your convenience. Nothing to add from that. I want the same bank to be my... A bank account as well. Bank account. If I go to Dubai, it will be my main bank in Dubai. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Even the income from the apartment will be going there. Going to that bank account. I got it. Yeah. You will share that with the tenant who was over there. There and everything. Yeah. I got it. So, which means the mortgage which you will be taking, half of your rent will be already deducting the amount which you have to give back to the bank and half will be saving. Yeah, yeah. Perfect. For me, that's the best plan. Yeah, inshallah. Okay. Someone told me, you know, when you take mortgage in Dubai, you have to take big amounts because it's always better to take big amounts first time. Does that make a difference? I will tell you, 250, at least if nothing, minimum 250 you have to take. Okay. Now, your case is you want 200, right? They will put a request and see the special approval if we get 200. If not, then 250 at least that you can get. I don't care. I can leave the extra in the accounts. Exactly. See, 250 is the minimum. Yeah. I don't know if I should maybe at some point buy another property and have the rent for that to pay the mortgage. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to also the flexibility to do that in the future because this property is just for the money. Yeah, you should be doing that because you know, UA gives 50%. You just have to put 50% towards the property and 50% up to 60 even gives some bank gives 60% of what? Yeah, but I don't want the next property to be because this one when I bought it, you can imagine I bought it 20, 16. Okay. Off plan. Yeah, completely off plan. So because of Corona and everything that goes even more to it. It took a lot of time. Yeah. So this was the main problem for me. So if I want to take second property, I want it to be ready. Yeah, ready to go for ready to move it and a prime place. If you want to put it on rent, take a prime place. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just giving you all my thoughts. Maybe that will help you to, you know, put the right time. Yeah, exactly. I got it. I got it. I got it completely. Great. Perfect. Perfect. Thank you so much, Mr. Yusuf for giving me your information. You have a lovely evening. Amazing. What's your good name? Yuraira. Yuraira. Yuraira. Yeah. Yuraira. Yeah. Yuraira. Yuraira. Yeah.

This call is from GoldenVisa, we received a request from NSCI property stating that you're looking for Pripko. Yes, yes. I am the owner of NSCI property basically. And I work with Pripko. And my RM is Shahzad Satheel. And I had discussed this case with him and he told me that he had discussed this case with you guys. So he told me to apply through the Pripko system. Okay, now I understand that. But right now I can see in the description it's clearly mentioned that about the person details. Specifically, there is one thing which I wanted to discuss about the salary which is mentioned as 27500. Around that much, yeah. Yeah, because the minimum requirement to get the GoldenVisa based on the salary, the professional visa, is 30,000 dirhams. If not, if they have any investments of 2 million dirhams or more, they can apply for that. No, no, it doesn't have an investment. But last time when I spoke to Shahzad, he told me that sometimes they consider less than 30,000. No, sir, because this is based on the government. Because once we take down your details, we will put you across with the government, then they will approve based on the salary. If the salary says 30,000, they will not. But what I can do is I will have a word with the GoldenVisa team and I will see if there is any possibility. And even I will check about this conversation which was done before with Shahzad, you mentioned me. Yeah. Okay, I will check on that as well. If there is any possibility, surely I will get back to you again. What about the second criteria? Her education. She is a master's in the education. Yeah, that is what. There are two types of visa. One is golden, one is professional. For professional visa itself, I am talking about is 30,000 salary. For GoldenVisa, it is based on the investment of 20,000, sorry, 2 million dirhams, which is fully paid. Then they are eligible for GoldenVisa. All right. All right. So let me have a word with the team. If there is any chance of going out for within the salary you have mentioned, 27,500, surely I will get back to you and give you an update. If not, I will update the details in the system that it is not possible or possible only. All right. Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time. Have a good day, Mr. Laush. Bye.\",\n",

No, please, please no problem at all. You know, I was traveling, I just come back. So it's been crazy to come back and I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the information that I have right now is like you're looking to buy two bedroom flats with around of 200, sorry, two million. Is it like you have paid to 100,000 as a down payment already? I've not done anything because I've been a stage where I'm starting to look, but wherever I look, they always ask me if I've gone and received a bank loan or if I have done any analysis of what is the extent to which I can receive a mortgage. And that's when I spoke to Frank, a friend of mine who works for this real estate company, and he said that you all have tied up. I think both your companies have tied up. And I said we have this mortgage because I've gone to him being a friend of mine. I've gone to him to help me with looking for the possibility of buying a two bedroom place. Now, naturally, I've got the survey and therefore I think this whole idea of talking to you to help me understand to what extent I can actually take a loan. All right. All right. So I really speaking, what I'm going to do is I will first try to understand your profile. Okay, and I'll forward the details to one of my mortgage advisor. They will check the current offers that are going with the bank and we will call you at your convenient time. Okay, so it can be today before seven or maybe by tomorrow. I would suggest tomorrow. Today. If you want to talk to me after seven, not before seven. Okay. All right. I'll be more relaxed after seven because I'm just again meeting up to be done. I agree. I agree. So nevertheless, you are looking for property. Like, do you have any property value in your mind at the moment? So it all depends on to what extent I have a relatively nice deal. I have a relatively decent salary. I have a decent amount that I can actually put down in the down payment as well. But I do I want to be it's a first time buying Dubai. So I want to I'm being a more conservative buyer. I have seen from friends who have invested in Dubai that one of the things is they have different options. So one friend invested in the MR, the waterfront, the new, you know, the new apartment. So he managed to get a deal where he basically is he pays only rent and the rent gets adjusted against the EMI. Okay. So he has a great deal. He's not on a single penny of a down payment. You know, he calls me. I have also managed to get a concept where he's paid a very minimal down payment and then he has had a loan over a period of time. Now I take loans, so I would rather finish something sooner than later. Exactly. I just want to see how can I, you know, make this work if you can. What is this concept called loan to buy or something that's a concept, right? Not loan to buy, then to buy something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Correct. I would say, Frank, that I would, I really like something like that, that I don't put in, even if I have to or I don't have to, give me a certain deal, but I would prefer your property than an old, but again, someone who can guide me and then need that, there is a certain appreciation that if I'm in this country for, I have a golden visa, by the way. So if I'm in this country for three, four, seven, eight, ten years and when I do want to either rent it out or sell it, then there is a certain return on investment, not that, you know, like I've always heard people lose a lot of money in Dubai. Got it. Got it completely. Sure. So, you know how? Obviously, I keep that guidance. Sure, definitely. So everything will be like my, one of my colleagues will definitely call you and give you complete information about the same. So you don't really have to worry about that. Talking about the option of the down payment is something that's not in our control that only can be done by the broker. Okay. Once you finalize the property, so you will understand how much is a down payment that you will actually be making with them. So right now we will be helping you get good deals from the bank. So we do have time with all the major bank in the UAE. So right now you have any active loans like auto loan or mortgage or anything right now? No loans. No loans at all? No. Okay. And how about credit cards? Credit cards, as usual, the monthly which goes about what I think my credit card is always in the range of 10,000-12,000. It's not much. Sure. So how many total credit cards do you have? One only. I have another one which is more debit card that's just used by the family. So there's only one credit card. One I think there's only one credit card. Or maybe I think two, sorry, two, but it's less than even maximum I would say is about 200 dirhams a month. So it's just used by my sister. Yeah, so it's like very minimal. And how much is the total limit of Vodakars? My card is I think 60,000 or something like that, 50-60,000. I think so. I'm not even sure on this. Sure, that's fine. That's fine. But WallPak is like 60,000, right? Yeah, I think so, yeah. I'm a premier customer with HSUPC. Okay. So you have HSUPC credit card? I have an HSUPC credit card, correct. Okay. And Meenu, how old are you? I am 43. 43. And you're currently working or yourself employed? I'm the vice president of a company. So I'm working. Wow. And just for the information purpose, how much is your salary? Yeah, absolutely. My salary, you know, do you want to just the net or gross? So when I talk gross, I talk even bonus. So when I talk net, I talk without bonus. Yeah, it's net. Net, 44,000. 44,000. So thank you so much, pretty much information that I wanted. I have it. And yeah, you're originally from which country? So originally born in India, but with a British passport. Sure. So you have a British passport right now? Yeah. Okay. All right. And you have a golden visa as well? As I have a golden visa as well, yes. Okay. All right. So I have the information with me. I will try to get a call back today after seven or maybe tomorrow after seven. Is that okay with you? Yes, absolutely. Not a problem at all then, my dear. I do apologize because it's just been really, really damaged. Yes, yes, yes. I totally agree and understand. So everything, the details that I wanted, it's with me. And yes, you will be receiving a call today or maybe tomorrow. But yeah, in these two days, you will be getting a call back. Okay, perfect.

So actually if you're thinking like globally it's like more like safety for the bank and it seems like you rather like perks from it from like it seems like but actually it's really risky. So. I wanted to say that I didn't get the story. So because let's see you're receiving a salary from this bank right? Yeah, so of course they will give you that kind of offer because in the bank there is STL like salary transfer as you receive an salary from this bank and non-STL. So STL is of course for the bank it's safety for them but actually and for you it seems like for you it seems like it's a profitably for you but actually it's too risky because you get an offer. I don't see it too risky. Why do you think it's risky? So let's imagine if you will leave at the company and everything they will like you will not receive an that salary from that bank and also like you will join a new company you will need showing them the proof so it will also take a time. So if they will see that you didn't like pay that per month's per month's loan like for one to three months they're going to change the salary or they're going to change the rate. So this is could happen. So that's why I'm telling you it could be like risky for you. It's not only like I'm just trying but I'm just like we're just trying to help you out and just to avoid like any risky you know like in the future. Look I understand what you're saying but I don't see it as risky like you're saying because then I change my company for four months ago. It's my salary and I stopped it but they deducted my condo from the accounts that they improved so it was paid. So there's no way I forced you to do that. Okay. Okay. Anyways. No I mean if you have something that's worth a cent lower grade lower interest rate I'm happy to consider. Otherwise anyways what was the bank device credit right? It's for 99. It's not you got to tell your transfer. Again can you can you can you come again the last sentence which you say? Like I said even even by selling bank it's for 99 without selling transfer so I'm not sure what risk and so on. So I'm fine to come I still have it got back to and they give without the selling of the transfer more the trade for 99. So this is what we can do. I can just like forward your request and you will talk with us with the mortgage advisor and he will explain to you like maybe more detail but I just wanted to clarify the moment before I was like forwarding your request with the mortgage advisor that why you're given this the best offer from your bank. Why was this like 4.8? That's fine but anything about that 4.89 not 4.8 anything about that I would not consider but anybody giving an offer if I transfer my salary I'll be happy to consider that too. Anybody giving 4.69 or 4.49 if I transfer my salary I'll consider that because I don't say challenge with transferring salary and if I change the work they block what my end of service. Yeah. So I'll give you a 2 month or 3 month mortgage anyways. So I'll find it and I'll lower your issue. Okay. So you can give that option the mortgage advisor as well but anything about 4.8 right I don't consider. Okay okay got it. Yeah. Yeah anyways I will then like forward your request and he will give you a call okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bye bye.\",\n",

Yes, I have five minutes now. That's good. That will be more than enough. So I've got your details from one of our channel partners for mortgage assistance. You're planning to buy a property, is it? Correct, yes. Your budget is around 1.5 to 2 million. Is that correct? Yes, I would say around 2 million. It's maybe 2.5 or something like this. Okay, it's already mentioned you had taken a pre-approval from CBD, Commercial Bank of Dubai. And that pre-approval has expired. Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. Okay, the property you're buying, is it going to be your first in the UAE? Yes, my first property is EDUAE. Okay, and which country passport do you hold, sir? France. Is it going to be a ready to move in property or under construction? It is most likely ready to move in. I'm looking at different options, but the most likely is an existing apartment, not an off-plan. Okay, perfect. And are you comfortable paying 20% down payment? 20% on 1.8, 1.9, that would be 360. Yes. I could pay that or is it going to impact the rate or what? The rate doesn't change, but that is the minimum requirement. If you are not able to pay, we will try to get you a loan from the bank on a separate basis. Like apart from the mortgage, we will answer you with a personal loan. You will have two installments and two different loans to pay. It becomes difficult for you, but if you want it that way. Okay, no, I can manage otherwise. Okay, perfect. All right, can I know your age, please? Sorry, say it again. Can I know your age? 47. Okay, and are you buying the property alone or do you have co-applicant? I would buy it with my wife, who is also 47. And is she working over here in UAE? No, she is not working at the moment. No income? No, no income. Okay, then what you can do is you can put her name as a co-owner for the property, but for the bank loan, she cannot be a co-applicant because it can only be a earning member. Okay, that's fine as long as she can be a co-owner. She will be on the papers, not on the bank papers for the loan. Okay. Now, how long have you been UAE resident? I've been UAE resident. When did I get my first UAE ID? Approximately, if you remember. One year, one year, one and a half year. Okay, and are you salaried over here or self-employed? No, salary. Salary, you know, I have worked for a multinational company. Fantastic. How much is a salary if I may ask? One million euro. Okay, that's monthly? No, that's yearly. How much would it be approximately on monthly basis? Monthly basis, that would be, I don't know, that would be 20,000 or not. 80,000, 85,000? Is that dirhams or dollars? Zero, zero, zero. Okay, perfect. 30,000, right? Yeah. And do you have any loans from any bank, personal loan, car loan? No, yeah. No, car loan is with the company, it's not with the bank. Okay, with the company? Yeah, yeah. Okay, and credit card from any of the banks? I have a credit card with HSBC. HSBC, and what is the limit approximately for that card? 40,000, 40,000. Is that the only card? Correct, yes. Okay, perfect. See, I've got all the details that I require for the basic understanding of your profile. I'm going to share it with our mortgage offices so that we can check with the banks that we are dealing with. We work with all the major banks in the UAE, we have contracts in place with them, and we don't charge you anything, the service is free of cost for you. Okay, excellent. Okay, you'll get a call within 24 hours with an update, with an offer, and the rates will be discussed with you from my team. Okay, excellent, perfect. Thank you, sir, you have a good day.

Is that correct? Correct. Okay. I need to just ask you a few questions to understand your profile so that we can share it with our mortgage team for processing. Yeah. Now we don't charge you anything. Our service is free of cost. Okay. We work with all the major banks in UAE for you to get the mortgage. So we'll get you multiple options or the best rate possible in the market. Mm-hmm. Now, have you already finalized or shortlisted the properties? No. Okay. So you're still looking out for options? Yeah. Okay. Is this going to be your first property in the UAE? Yeah. And have you got a budget in mind? How much you're approximately going to spend for it? Um, so actually the mortgage probably needs to be a little bit lower because I would like to buy a house of about 2 million. Okay. Okay. 2 million is including the down payment or excluding the down payment? Including. Okay. So you're comfortable paying 20% down payment out of 2 million which will be close to 400,000. Yeah. All right. And are you salaried over here or self-employed for UAE? Salary. And how much is your salary if I may ask? Including benefits or base? The fix that you get every month in the account? 45,000. Okay. And you have other allowances as well? Uh, yeah, but minor. No problem. And which country passed for the USA? Netherlands. All right.

And can I know if you have any loan from any bank right now in UAE? Personal loan, car loan? Hello? Hello? Sorry, Rohan. I was accidentally muting myself. No, I don't have any loans. No loans. No car loan as well? Correct. Okay. Great. Credit cards from any bank? Yeah. ADCB. And what's the limit if I may ask? 30,000. Okay. That's the only card? Yeah. Um, yeah, I actually have two from ADCB, I think, but I only use one anywhere. No problem. And the property that you're looking for, is it going to be ready to move in near completion or under construction? Probably ready to move in. Okay. Perfect. Because most of the mortgage is only for ready to move in on your completion projects. Yeah. Okay. I've got all the details required for the pre-screening and for our team to assess your profile. We will share it with the banks that we work with so that we can get the best rate possible and we will contact you again within 24 hours with an offer. Okay. Okay. Fantastic. Thank you.

You were saying like you're looking for the property with the value like 1.2 to 1.4, right? Yes, between that range. I'm looking at a certain area at the moment and they have different properties ranging. So, I haven't chosen a specific one so I don't have a specific price at that range. I see, I see. So, I just wanted to make sure that we're on the same page. Our company, we're helping to the customers like to take a mortgage when not the property. Of course it is. Yeah, okay, perfect.

She's the director of the sales. She's from the MAC and she's the director in the MAC of the sales and the marketing. So, she opened this company recently. Okay. And our company, we have like contracts with all the major banks of Dubai. Okay. So, our consolation from our side is a free of charge for you. We just get a commission from the bank that she will be looking for proceed with the particular bank. Okay. And the first step, yeah. And the first step, I just need to ask you a question in order to check your eligibility for taking a mortgage. Yes. Yeah. As I see that you're eligible for taking a mortgage, I will forward your request to the mortgage advisor department and he will just give you the complete information regarding the mortgage, the bank rates, like terms and conditions of the bank, like which is the requirement, documents, et cetera. Okay. But of course, if I will be aware of some information and you will have some questions, I can answer you on this. Like basic, I can give you like some basic information. Understood. No problem. Okay. Perfect. So, Mayno, what's your age? My age? I'm 38. 38. Perfect. And Mayno, like are you taking the mortgage under your name? Yes, it will be under my name. Ideally, I actually want it under mine and my wife's. Okay. But the mortgage will be under my name, I guess. I just need the T to come and help. Okay. Good. And Mayno, since what year are you resident of UAE? UAE since 2012. 2012. Okay. And what's your current job tenure? My position is a project manager. I'm working with company IML group and I've been working with them for the last six years. Okay. For the last six years. And Mayno, where are you from? What's the national? South Africa. South Africa. Okay. Give me one sec. No problem. Okay. And so, you're a celebrity, right? I'm a celebrity, yeah. Okay. Mayno, what's your celebrity per month? My basic celebrity is 17. And then obviously the bank's business will show that this is commissioned based as well. Because it's sales or in place itself. So you're in the, okay. And Mayno, what's your commission? Usually per month. It ranges from about 3000 to about five and a half. Okay. So that's the average. So it's a 17, let's say like combined with a five. So you never, every celebrity that you get, like every month is 22. So that's the average. So that's the average. So that's the average. So that's the average. So that's the average. And then you can see like combined with a five. So the average, the salary that you get, like every month is 22,000, right? Yeah. Like I said, it can be some months as you know, market sometimes it's a little bit slow. So the commission is not that great. But so you can say anywhere between 20 and 22. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I completely understand that. Yeah. Okay. So you still didn't finalize in the property, right? You still look at the option. Yeah. I've been speaking to a couple of people, obviously, in terms of just what they have to offer and the prices and stuff like that. So I'm not finalizing that. Okay. Okay. And may I know, is it the property that you're going to buy? Is it going to be off plan? What I mean, like under construction or ready to move in? The current ones we're looking at is in Rukan. They are still, they're off plan basically, but I believe some of them are already or for handover in June. Okay. According to developers. So they're almost in the, they're finished basically. So we went to watch, check some of them. It's literally just touch ups and then it's completed. So according to developers, I think handover is June. Okay. Okay. Perfect. What I'm asking this question, because like if we were willing to proceed with the off plan, that like the percentage of construction should be ready at least for 50 or 60%. Okay. Yeah. I think these are about 85 plus. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. So may I know, do you have any liability such a car loan, personal loan? Loans I do not have. Okay. And what's the, what's the total limit of the credit card? I have two, one is 10, one is 20. Okay. So it's 30. Okay. Yeah. I'm planning to close the 10 one. So that's also the option if it doesn't pay. Yeah. Maybe. Sometimes like the, they're asking like to reduce the amount, like the, reduce the limit of the credit cards because it's also like influence on the, like on the mortgage. Yeah. I'm just saying. Yeah. Okay. So, so far I can see that you're eligible for taking the mortgage. So right now what I do, what I mentioned earlier, I will forward your request to the mortgage advisor department and they will give it a call as soon as possible. Okay. I'm also just one, just one question. I don't know if it's possible. Is it also a possibility if me and my wife basically apply as, as a. Yeah. Yeah. It's, yeah, it's easily. So because right now in the system, I don't have this option to also feel the information about my wife, but the manual, like your wife is, is she. It's, it's, sorry, you see, is she celebrate or self-employed? Yeah. She's celebrated as well. Okay. And she is a resident resident as well, right? Yeah. She's in the company as well. Yes. I think she's been employed by this company for the last four years or four or five or not a hundred percent. She worked for a semi-government places in New York capital. And her, I think her salary is around seven, five, also with commissions variable. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Yeah. Of course, easily you can apply as a husband and wife. As far as I know that you will be dressed one of the certain documents will be required your marriage certificate. Of course. Yes, we have. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, it's easily you can apply as a wife or husband. Yeah. Just because obviously like I said before, the one thing is, yes, the mortgage will be on me, but I would like to have the deed basically in the two names. And I think it's easier that way. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Thank you for your time and your patience and sharing your information. Okay. No problem. Yeah. Have a nice day. You too. Thank you very much for the hope. Yes. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.\",\n",

I'm calling you from Prip Code Services regarding your inquiry for the mortgage. Oh, yes. Yes. I hope this is a good time. Can we talk about it? Yes, please. Thank you very much. So I'll quickly do one thing. I'll just take down all your details and then we can go ahead and check the eligibility for you. And once our mortgage export will be getting in touch with you after evaluating the best deal available. Okay. Yeah. Can I ask you, are you a resident in UA or non-resident? Yes, I am. Okay, great. I'm a resident, yeah. Sure. Just give me a while. I'll quickly note it down. And how about your salary details? Are you working or your... I am working. You're working. All right. And what's your current salary? It's approximately 20,000. 20,000. And which Emirates do you stay in, in UA? Dubai. All right. And how about your length of residency? Since how many years are you here in UA? It's 11 plus. More than 11 years. All right. And the property which you have finalized, is it a ready to move in property or is it... Yes, it is. Okay. And how about your length of, you know, in the company? Like how long have you been in this company? 11 years. 11 years. The same. I joined the same company. So when you came to UA, you have joined the same company since then? Yeah. Okay. And you told me your salary is more than 20,000. How about your age? I am 39. Sure. And do you hold any liabilities in UA? Like credit cards, mortgage or... Well, I have credit cards, but they're all up to date. Yeah. But I'll just need, you know, fairs, just the information about your limit on the card. I put really basic limits. One is 10,000 and the other one is actually 10,000. Okay. So just two cards with a limit of 10 each? Yeah, correct. All right. Any other auto loans, personal loans, nothing else? No, no, no. No. I had it. I had a personal loan, but that was long time back. Okay. That's fine. That's okay. Just one moment. And how about the value of the property you have chosen? You know, sorry. I just did my night shift, so I've been... No problem. I'm sorry to, you know, call you at this time after your night shift. No, no, no, no. It's okay. Yeah. Now, I have... I've actually looked at two properties. So now it depends on the amount of loan I get. If I would want to buy both of them. Mm-hmm. So the amount approximately for each is around 800,000 to 9000,000. For each, right? Yeah. So approximately 1.6. That's correct. You can say. Okay. All right. So let's do one thing. I'll just mention your 1.6 million, you know, just on rough figure. So once they will calculate, they will discuss with you. You can finalize which property you would like to go with. Or maybe we get the approvals for both. So, you know, you can go with the maximum, the total amount. Okay. Yeah. And this is your first property in UAE, right? That's correct. Sure. So just to keeping you updated, because at times the banks, they ask the client to pay a 20% down payment towards the property. So in case if we do not get the final, you know, approval with the down payment inclusive, then you might will have to go ahead and make the payment. Just keeping you aware. You know, that definitely you will have to make the payment. It might come out how much 20% of the total amount. I don't understand. Can you please repeat it? Sure, I'll do that. So 20% of the total value of your more of your property will have to, you know, will have to be paid upfront as a down payment towards the property. But that's what the procedure is, right? Exactly. It's a procedure. So at times the client has to pay and sometimes, you know, the bank takes care of it. So you don't have to pay. Oh, like I don't even have to pay the initial 20% as well. Exactly. So in case if we do not get the approval for that. Yeah. If we get an approval for that also, that'll be great. And if I don't have to put anything from my pocket, but if I do have to, of course, then I'll do. And if it can be reduced to, you know, maybe sometimes they do it at 90% or 80% and all that, that works out. That would be amazing anyway. Right. So we are just keeping our clients informed in the first call itself, you know, at times they're not aware of that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, that is fine. Thank you for informing me. No problem. Thank you, Amit. And I've got your details. I'll be forwarding it to one of my, you know, a clicker league here in a different department and they will be calling you back. You can expect your call in next 48 hours. Okay. What department are you in? Sorry. So I'm calling you from the telecalling department. So we do the evaluation. We do the eligibility details and everything we take over every detail from the customer. And then we forward it to the mortgage advisor. Okay. Okay. Thank you. What's your good name? My name is Naila. Naila. Okay. Naila. Thank you so much. You're most welcome. Have a great day. Bye. You too. Have a good day. You too. You too. You too. Bye. Bye.\",\n",

Thank you. I have received an inquiry from Mr. Yogesh Patawari who works in Eminence state that you are interested in taking mortgage. Is that correct? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Are you still looking for the property or it's already finalized? I'm actually looking for the property in that one. I have someone who is in my mind. So I just want to know how the mortgage proposal is. Okay. All right. So it works like you are a resident, right? So any bank over here can give you mortgage up to 80%. Okay. Okay. Okay. Based on your profile and there are different rates from different banks, like rates of fluctuating and based on your profile or preference, whatever bank you want to go with, whichever bank you want to go with, you have an option you can. We can give you the pre-approval and yeah. Later you can prevail. You can avail that within 45 days. Yeah. Okay. I understand. Yeah. So what I just... Are you a resident of Dubai? I have to ask you a few questions so that I can have some profile. Yeah. I understand. The thing is that I have, I will just give you some details about me. The thing is that I'm an investor in Dubai actually. You are an investor. Yeah. We are an investor. Okay. Okay. Okay. What is the source of income? My source of income is business only. Business only. Can you just tell me what is this turnover or like monthly or year? So my business is a new setup actually. It's just how operation goes for the eight months only till now. Eight months. So I don't think that's eligible for it. So for example, it is a new business now. So it's my asset now is... What was it? What was it? Six months? Yeah. Now it's eight months. About to get it one. I'm saying till six months what it was. Sorry what? I'm saying till six months. What revenue you saw? Can you just give me figure out on basis of your six months? The first six months is hardly 30,000 or something monthly. What's my revenue for first six months? Okay. So if we say 30,000... So it was already 180,000, right? Yeah. Correct. Correct. 180,000. And if we talk about last three months bank statement, have you maintained 25,000 dirhams? Not always. It's like 15, 20, sometimes it's like what goes. So if we can like I can like prepare for it. That's also fine. Like maybe like six months if I have to manage some balances that I can do. Yeah. So what happens is once we require documents from your side, so the balance which you should have maintained from last three months should be 25,000. Like at least we should be untouchable. If it goes low then no. Yeah. That is fine only. It does. Hold. Can you just give me a minute? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure if it's okay. That's not okay. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Hm? Hm? Hello? Yeah, yeah, thank you. Thank you so much for holding. What I, what you know is you can get up to 60% loan. I called the deposit holders, right? Yeah, because of your business, because it's very less than ours. Yeah. And on basis of that, you can get up to 60%. That is what we can do where we require less documents from your site. That is called low document mortgage. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, is that okay? Shall we proceed? Ah, so you're saying that with my, right now, the state months of business itself, I can get the 60% of the home loan, right? Yeah, you can get 60% of mortgage. Okay, I understand. Okay. Yeah. So, I just want to know one more option, whether like, what if one person salary, like my brother, he's salary here. So, he got like salary around 6000. So, will he able to... No, no, no, minimum salary should be 15,000. 15,000, right? Yes. Okay, okay. What about a foreigner like, you are... Non-resident, yeah. Non-resident gets up to 50% or 60% of mortgage and the interest rate is high for them rather than a resident gets, yeah. For me, how much in this person it will be? It's for you, it will start from 3.99. A monthly? Sorry? Is it monthly or yearly? 3.99. So, 3.99 will be added to the whole amount and then for how many years you have taken the mortgage for, then they will divide the amount in how many months it is coming and then they will give you the AMIs for a month. What kind of annual is that, right? No, you have to pay monthly, but which comes very less because you... They will divide, yeah. Yeah, that I understood like in the system annual basis, right? Yeah. And one more thing, is it diminishing rate or flat rate? See, what happens is there are some banks who are giving, you know, the first five years they are giving certain rate which is fixed. Some banks, they are giving two years with the rate is fixed. What they say is it's going to fluctuate after that. Say two years, they say it and then after two years it can go down or it can go up, according to the central bank. And there are some banks who give fixed rate for five years. So, it depends which bank is going to give you mortgage and what is the offer they are currently having. Okay, okay, I totally understand. So, actually I have to discuss my family then I will give you the final confirmation. One more thing, if I have to get the loan then I have to keep a minimum balance of 25,000 untouched in my business. Yes, it should be untouchable. Yeah. Okay, for the minimum, right? Okay, yeah. And whatever the previous value that is fine, right? Yeah, for now this is fine but at least it should be more than, you know, 500,000 or like this. 100,000, I understand. Yeah, you agree. Yeah, but for now it's fine, right? Yeah, for now it's fine. Low document up to 60% based on your profile you can get. Okay, okay, we will not be okay. So, should I call you back in the same number? Yeah, you can call me or you can just tell me when I can give you a call tomorrow. Okay, okay, okay, that's fine. Okay, thank you. Thank you. All right, thank you. Have a wonderful day. Okay, great.\",\n",

No, it is completed. It is already finished by last month, right? No, this month it is finished. This month. So in May you will be making the last installment payment, right? Yes, sir. Okay. So in that case, I believe you still have the DVR space. Absolutely fine. You can go ahead and consider your DVR. I mean, it's still in place and we can get you a second mortgage. That's absolutely fine. You are a resident here in UAE? Yes, I am a resident in UAE. And you are here in the country for how long? How many years now? No, it is almost 11 years. 10 years is completed. 10 years. 10 and a half. Okay. And what's your age, sir? 38. Okay. And how about you are working, right? You told me your salary is 18,000. Okay, perfect. And one moment. And how long you have been working in the company in this employment? Six years. Six years completed. You told me there's no active liabilities in UAE, right? Apart from the EMI for the auto loan. Yes, yes. Can you also tell me the auto loan EMI? Auto loan, it is 1500 and only it is completed this month. So don't consider that one. I'll actually mention here in the comments that your auto loan last installment will be paid in May 2023. Yes. My inventory, I mentioned that it is completed also. Okay. Yeah, because your bureau still shows until it's active, your bureau report will still show it as an active bureau. Maybe I will take it after this month. Then it is fine. Yes, it is absolutely fine. Your nationality is Indian, right? Indian, right. Okay. And the property which you are looking for, is it in ready to move in property or it is off plan property? That is the one. Those details I don't, I want to be true and still I am not, I am planning to purchase a town hall which is the one it is already completed. Then I can move directly and I pay something to mortgage and the remaining I'll give it an installment like that. Right. And your approximate value you have in your mind for the property? Yes. One point, one maximum. One point, one one point, one maximum. One point, one to one point, two maximum. Okay. Yes. All right. And this is not your first property, right? You already have one mortgage, you hang on. Yes. Okay. And there will be a down payment of 20% in case if you are, you know, going to choose a ready to move an apartment or a, you know, property, then it will be, there will be a down payment of 20%. I hope you're aware about that. Yes, yes. Okay. And any location, which area you're looking in and, you know, any project name particularly? No, still not at finalize. Not finalize. Which is the one I'm looking in that we are not at finalize. Okay. All right. No issues. So what I'll do is I'll say that. I want to understand that this eligibility I can able to. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. First we'll check the eligibility for you. Once the eligibility is done, we will give you a call. We'll share with you the details and the options that we have from the bank. So whichever is the best offer you can compare accordingly and you can go ahead, you know, accordingly as per your interest. Okay. Yeah. So you'll be receiving a call. Yeah. Yeah. You'll be receiving a call from one of the mortgage experts in next 48 hours maximum. Okay. You are from mortgage department? We are also from the mortgage team, but you know, we have to first take down the details to do the valuation and, you know, check the eligibility for the client. And then we give them a call. So now for next step forward, you'll be getting a call from them. Okay. Number one. So you'll see now you, I want another question from my side. Number two, it is one is that, see how are existing mortgage loan in that EBR it is the E-BOR value. It is there. The E-BOR it is getting more every time. So how can I, I want the solution from you and how I can able to resist that. So in that case, so you have to go with the fixed rate because there are two types of rates the bank will offer you. There's a fixed rate and one is variable, which is a, you know, intro variable rate. So that will change according to the market conditions. So your rate is increasing. If the market of the US market has, you know, it's not stable, then it will be changed. Your rate will also modify. So always choose a fixed rate. So the fixed rate means already I have taken from the immigration. So I can able to change it means. No, once the plan is on, then you cannot change the rate during, you know, between the plan. So you will have to complete that. Otherwise you will have to buy out it from another bank and request for a fixed rate. So the buyout can happen. Any which means you can partner with the mortgage advisor also. If he can get you or something better offer what you're paying currently on the first mortgage, we can go, we can do that. We can go ahead with that. Okay. Okay. I understand. No problem. I think anything else apart from this I can help you with. No, no. Fine. Okay. Have a wonderful day ahead then. So take care. Bye-bye. Thank you.\",\n",

       "  'content': {'text': \" Hello. Yes, hi, good morning. Am I calling Mr. Rizwan? Yes, speaking. Hi, Rizwan. My name is Naila and I'm calling you from PIPCO Services. How are you doing today? I'm fine, thank you. Yeah, I hope this is a good time to talk to you. It's regarding your mortgage assistance inquiry. Yes. Yes. All right. So, yeah, I'll just quickly verify a few details. You have already mentioned here that you're looking for an 80% mortgage on one of your property, which you have chosen in Alforjan and the value of the property is 6.8 million. It's a villa, right? Yes. Okay, great. Wonderful. So, I'll quickly take down all your other details apart from this because we have to evaluate and check the details. And then one of my mortgage experts will be getting in touch with you. Okay. Yeah. Can I ask you if you're a resident in UA or non-resident? A resident. And you're working here or do you own a company or a business? I'm working. All right. And what about your monthly salary? 200K. And you're working in this employer with this company? Yes. Okay. What about your monthly salary? 200K. And you're working with this employer for how many months? Seven years. All right. You're here in UA since when? Since November 21. No, like you're working in this company for seven years, but you're in the country as an UA since 2021? 21, November 21. Yes. I've been in Kenya before. Okay. And we just moved with the same company in Dubai. Perfect. Just give me one moment. And can I have your age? 55. Sure. And how about do you have any liabilities here in UA? No. Nothing at all, right? No credit cards, auto loans, nothing. Nothing. I don't use it. Can I just ask you the limit of the card, even if you're not using it? 200K. The hard bureau will have it. Yeah. 200K. And can I have your nationality, please? Belgium. But you were working in Kenya, right? Before. I was working in Kenya before, yes. Okay. The property which you have chosen, is it ready to move in or an off-plan property? It's ready to move in three months, two, three months. So by the time that we perfect everything, I'll be ready to move. Okay. All right. But right now it's not ready to move in. It's off-plan, right? It's off-plan, yes. Under-plan. Okay. How about the address? It's the same, right? Which you have mentioned, Alfa, Jan, Willa. Yeah. Okay. The price you have already stated, this is going to be your first property in UA? Yes, first. First one. All right. Great. There might be a 20% down payment which has to be paid by the owner of the property. So I hope you are aware about that, right? Yeah, I'm aware. No problem. Perfect. Thank you, Mr. Rizwan. I'll just do one thing. I'll forward your details to one of my colleagues and they will be getting in touch with you in the next 48 hours, Maximo. Okay. Other question. I still have to pay 6% for the registration and broker fee. Certain banks, they are paying 70% of that amount. Is that possible? See, I'll check that for you. I'm not completely sure about that, but I can put a query for you that if you want to pay or no. And they will be confirming as well with you. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Have a great day. Bye-bye. You too. Bye-bye.\",\n",

Thanks for asking. Ma'am, I got your number from our real estate partners. One of the agents, her name is Rwana, that you are interested in getting mortgage. Am I correct? Yeah. You want to understand the other set of work? Okay, ma'am. So this is just a qualifying check call to check your eligibility. So I would love to ask you some questions. Is that okay with you? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. So if I may ask first, are you a resident or a non-resident? No, I'm a non-resident. What do you mean? I mean, I have my non-resident. If you're a resident, like you're working in UAE or... Oh, yeah, yeah, you know, I'm working here, yeah, I'm a resident, yeah. Okay, so you're a resident here. Okay. So may I know your age? 38. 38, okay. So are you a seller or you own a business? Selleried. Selleried. Okay. So may I ask how much is your monthly income? 48. Okay, 48. So may I ask the duration, how long have you been in the company, where you're working? This is two and a half years. Two and a half years. Yeah. Okay, ma'am. Okay, so may I know, you have any liabilities like credit card, car loans or... Yeah, I've got a car loan at the moment, yeah. I'm paying over car, yes. Car loan? Okay, so... Yes. Okay. So what about credit cards? You don't have any? I have one, but it's not really... There's nothing much on it, there's about 2000 dirhams on there now. And then use, use or... Okay, on credit card you have 2000 dirhams on there, yeah? Yeah. So on the car loan, like how much are you like paying a monthly or some? It's about 3000. Okay, 3000, okay. Yeah. So are you looking for ready to move in property or... I wanted to... Yeah, I wanted to understand what options you are having ready to move in and what you are having off plan? Yeah, so actually in ready to move in property, we can give you... You can have like up to 80% mortgage, but in an off plan, you will have like 60% and the property has to be up to almost finished for you to be eligible to get a mortgage. Oh. Yeah. Okay. So I will definitely advise if you can go for ready to move in property. Yeah. So you can get up to 80%, yeah? Yes, yes, yes. Okay, so ready to move in. So like do you have an idea of the value of the property you want, you want a loan for, like how much... Yeah, I don't know. I was thinking like what is it like look at the... The Mandirim mortgage would be maybe, I don't know, how does that work? So actually our mortgage advice will give you different rates based on the price of the property that you want to get. Yeah. That's why I'm asking the property for value of 700K, 1 million dirhams or 2 million dirhams. So like for how much do you... How much do I ask for between 800 to 1.2? Okay, 800 to 1.2. Okay. Yeah. So is this your first property in the UAE or...? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so if I may ask, man, which passport holder do you have? Nationality? South African, South African. South African, okay. Yeah. Okay. So do you have like an idea of the date of purchase, the date where you want to get the property or...? No, there's no rush for data, more understanding I want to obviously the base deal is the right... Just like an estimate, like let's say in one month time, because once you get the pre-approval, you have just like 48 days to finish the... Finish up with the deal. Oh really? Yeah, yeah. Sure. So wouldn't it be better to understand what is the options on the... What do you have with the process from a property point of view? Yeah, because actually, yeah, our mortgage advisor will give you an idea on all that. This is just like the quality check to check eligibility. So later we are going to transfer it to the mortgage advisor and then he's going to give you all the different rates that all... Because we have tights with that protein balance. So they will give you different different rates. So you will be the one to make the choice of which percentage you want to go for. Oh, okay, that's okay. So yeah, so just like we just know like the estimate, when do you want like start the procedure? Like when do you want to purchase the property? No, guys. Like one month time or two months time? No, I would say like in about maybe two months time, two or three months time, yeah. So towards the end of this year. Okay, okay. But November. Okay, let's say by November. Yeah. Okay, okay. So November is a little bit very far, man. I think like a period of like two months time will be maximum two months period time. Can you find a place in two months that you want to buy? I mean, can you really make a decision in two months for property that you want to buy? Is that realistic? Yeah, yeah. So actually the thing is that our mortgage advisor will give you more briefing about that. So we are just taking like a wrong like an extra like it's just a pre-qualifying call. A fault, yeah, a fault. Yeah, yeah. So later our mortgage advisor, you would then decide when you want to get the property or somehow. So he will ask you to add a pre-check. Okay, so you basically first do in a pre-check. Yes, then we would transfer it now to our mortgage advisor that will ask you to add the whole process. Okay, so will he do the assessment and the application to different banks? Yes. So you would choose then he would do the rest for you. Okay. Yeah, so. Because like Abu Dhabi is some bank at the moment, is that the bank that they go with or do they go into different banks and see what which bank gives the best rate? So actually what we do is we will give you the value of, we will give you the estimate of like 14 different banks. So you would choose. Either you want to go with your bank or you want to go with the, because maybe at that time Abu Dhabi rate is more higher than different banks. So you would be the one to choose with which one you want to go with. So that's this guy all about it. And what is the interest rate at the moment on the loan like the home loan of 1 million? So for that I can't give you exact information about that. So but that's the thing that our mortgage advisor will be more concrete and give you exact information that you really want to know about it. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay, then get him to call me. Okay. Thank you. Bye bye. Okay, thank you so much for this information. Bye bye. Thank you.\",\n",

I think we spoke yesterday, guys. Have we? Yeah, I think so. Because in my database, what it's showing is we haven't. Okay, alright. Anyway, how are you? Mr. Abia, it is regarding mod gauge. I have received an inquiry from Signature Habitat Properties from Manta Joshi that you are interested in looking to do bedroom apartment and you want mod gauge on that. Is that correct? Yes. Yeah, I'm calling you in regards to that. Have you spoken to any of my colleagues regarding this? I have heard a lot of calls the last few days. Okay, alright. But it is regarding mod gauge. Yes, yes. Yeah. So I have to ask you a few questions so that I can have your profile and my mod gauge advisor will give you a call and ask for documents. Is that okay? Yeah, sure. Okay, you are a resident of Dubai, right? Yeah. Okay, may I know how old are you? 52. Sorry? 52 years old. 52, 52, right? Yeah. Okay, are you salaried or self-employed? Salary. Salary. Okay. How much is the salary? 29,000. 29,000. Okay, how long you've been working with the current company? 11 years. 11 years in Dubai. Okay. Any liabilities you have? I mean credit cards, personal loan or card loan? Yeah, I do. I have credit card and a personal loan. Okay, you have a credit card. How many credit cards do you have? Just one. Just one? What is the limit to one second? Just one second. What company are you calling from? Pripyat Co-Services. Oh, you know what? What do you exactly do? We are giving services related to real estate, which includes mod gauge as well. And I have received an inquiry from Ms. Mamta Joshi, who works in Signature Habitat. So what are the findings or what do you do? Because I'm not sharing any more information on the phone. I'm sorry. Do you want my mod gauge advisor to directly give you a call because they will ask for the same information? Didn't Mamta Joshi told you that they will ask you these questions? No, she did not. I don't like to tell you, I can't remember who I spoke to. I read a lot of course. What I'm saying is I need to get something formal in writing because you're asking a lot of questions. Okay. Yeah, because we do ask these questions. These are the pre-qualification questions, which we have to know. That is fine. But I would prefer doing it differently. If you send me something on email, it's using yourself. Let me see your company profile. When I'm comfortable, then I will share my personal information. Okay, I will have a word with Ms. Mamta Joshi first and then maybe. I don't know what to do. You're not a bank, you can call us the brokers. So that's what I'm asking. That's how you should introduce and tell me the broker and stuff. Anyway, I would like to share the company profile. So far, all the calls are here. I've not shared any information. Okay, all right. Perfect. I'll do the same. Yeah, okay. Thank you. I can approach the bank directly if I want to, which I've done already. So I don't have to tell you what is the job of the broker in between. What we are doing is we can give you at the same time, we can give you a, you know, raise from different banks where you can get the different rates at the same time you have a choice. So that's how you should have to use the score. You don't just go straight out asking me a whole lot of personal questions. No, no, no, because you know the moment I ask you, I first ask you, is it okay? What is your company, what do they do? You know, there's many schemes going around and I'm not prepared to share any information on the call. Okay, all right. Okay, thanks a lot. Thanks. Good day.\",\n",

Mr. Ankit, the property is already finalized. Are you still in the market and looking for the options? I am still looking for the options. Okay. Perfect. I need to ask you a few more questions so that I can have your profile and later I will take you to the mortgage advisor and take your case forward. Okay. Are you the resident of the buyer? Pardon? Yes. You are the resident of the buyer? Yes. Okay. May I know how old are you? 33. Okay. Are you salaried or self-employed? Salaried. How much is the salary may I know? 22,000. 22,000.

So the property which you are planning to buy is it going to be ready to move in or off plan? Most probably ready to move in. Okay. And I can see in the description your budget is $781.2 million. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. And this is going to be the first property in UAE? Yes. All right. That's pretty much it. I will share the profile with my mortgage advisor. They will require some documents from your side and take your case forward. We'll give you the best rates, inshallah. Yeah. But what is the approximately amount that you all can give us? That is up to 80% you can get. Based on your profile? Yes, up to 80%. And that would be for a term off? Depends upon how much you want to take and probably 15 years, 20 years. And if you want to reduce the years, you can do that. We can do that on personal as well. Let's say if it is 15 years, what would be the monthly mortgage value? Depends upon the rate which is going on. For example, the rate right now is going from 3.99 to 5.99 or 4.99 like that. So say for example, if you go to the bank or the IB or this, say for example, they have 3.99 or 4.1. So the 4.1 will be added to the whole amount which you will be taking from the bank. And then they will divide that into how many months are there in that in those years and that will be your EMI then. Okay. And what if I repay it earlier? Will there be any reductions in the interest value? Maybe, yeah, there can be. Okay. Yeah. It's always circulating. I tried once for the credit card, I paid everything in advance and then they said like no. Credit card and mortgage is completely different. Credit card is a very small amount. Mortgage is a big amount, yeah? Okay. Okay. All right. When is the preferred time to call you? Probably around 4.30. 4.30? Okay. I will mention additional details. They will give you a call around 4.30. You have a good day. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.\",\n",

Yeah, first you will get the pre-approval, okay? They will let you know what interest rate and what, like from which bank you're getting the lowest. Okay? Yeah. So, I will just send the details to the mortgage advisor. The mortgage advisor will give you a call, sir. Okay? My salary is currently paid into the UK, but I could get it transferred to my account here in Dubai. In your UK account, your salary is getting treated there. There is any particular reason? That's easier to do the conversion because I get better rates doing it in the UK converting to Durham's, but I could get it converted to UK, I could get it transferred to Dubai in sterling, but I would still need to do the conversion. Okay, the company does provide the pay slips? Yes. Okay, in the pay slip, the account number will be mentioned, right? The UK account number. I don't know. I've got UK bank names I can share. That's not an issue, sir. You can send us the UK Bank statement, you can give it to us. When we're doing the documentation, you can give it to us, you know, the UK Bank statement.

And the deposit. They will give you the all the information. The market advisor will give you a call and they will give you the all the information. If it is needed, then do it. If it don't need, then not suggest to do it, to transfer it into an OAN in your Dubai account. Yeah, but when is the mortgage advisor going to call, and are they going to give me guidance on what the deposit would be? Are you free now?

Sir, I believe you have done an inquiry, the castee mortgage, are you looking for a mortgage services sir? I just, I just called from one of my, I guess your colleague or someone, they told that you would be calling and discussing about a mortgage process and all. Who has given you the call sir? Someone Aisha. Aisha has called you, like Aisha from broker right? Exactly. Okay, so I just need some few details to check your eligibility sir, okay. Are you residing in UAE or non-residencer?

Okay, and may I know like, how many credit cards do you have sir? I have only one I guess, the other cards are closed, but I am not sure. What is it? Close the, the one. Do you have a closer letter? No, I think one closer letter I will get it mostly by, by next month. You can see in your statement, credit card statement is showing zero limit, zero outstanding, right? No, no, one just is under process, one closure is under process. So you are doing the settlement or you have done the full amount? The full amount only. Not the settlement right? Not the settlement. That's good, okay. No, but there was no, just wanted to be clear, what is the difference between this I just want to understand. Settlement, it means like, if, if customer has not able to pay the full amount, they will, the customer pay lump sum amount. Like, for example, he has a big outstanding and he talked to the bank and he pays just a minimum amount for it. That is called a settlement. Okay, so it affect your process? ATR Bureau, yes, it will affect the ATR Bureau report, because the score will go down. Because you have done a settlement. If you have paid the full amount, the score will go up. That is the difference. Okay, okay. Actually, there was one card for the payment that I have done the settlement. But actually, that was not my mistake, but it's from the bank mistake. But as you know, the bank mistake, that is fine. They will say, no, no, but no, but the thing is that there was so much discussion happened and all those things. And I agree to pay some amount and I want them to close this thing. So this is what we have done. So maybe that's why I'm asking you to clarify. So anyway, so you can go ahead with your questions. Okay, in the menu, what is the total limit? I think the one, the card which I'm currently using is around 40 something. 40? Yeah, 40K. 40K. And do you have any personal loan?

And do you have any, like, car loan, auto loan? No, nothing. Okay. May I know what's your nostalgia? Indian. Okay, are you looking for ready to move in or looking for off plan? Ready to move in. Okay. Depending upon the, again, they depend upon the things, but as of now, it's ready to move in my mind. Okay. And like, how much loan are you looking for? This one, I told that I'm just looking for the property which is coming around 600 to 700. 600 to 700. Okay. And this will be a first property in UE? Yes. And like, when you're planning to buy a property? Now, this is ready to move. So mostly, it will be like in August or September? August or September. It means it's off plan, which you have seen the property? No, no, I didn't see anything so far. Okay. So you're planning to buy a property in August or September? Yes. Obviously, it will take that much time because I'm traveling in this coming month. So that's why I just told you the record. So once you get the pre-approval, you will only having to 40 to 45 days to finalize the property, sir. Okay. Yeah. Okay, let's see if I get the pre-approval. How much you will, let me know how much I can get it and what the... Yeah, yeah, they will let you know, sir. I will just write in my notes, customer wants to know how much you can get. Yeah.

I have received an inquiry from the Rean Real Estate that you are looking for mortgage. Is that correct? Hello. Yes, I am actually looking for a two-bit villa. And your budget is approximately one million. Is that correct? Yes. I need to know more information from your site so that I can have your profile and forward it to my mortgage advisors and they can take your case forward and get you the mortgage. Is that okay? Yes, I am fine. I just want to select the villa and then go ahead with this. There is no harm if we check for the pre-approval from the bank and you can have, you know, over-viv about the mortgage and everything within 45 days after getting the approval, you can finalize the property. Okay. Okay. I just quickly wanted to know, you are a resident of the buy, right? I am a resident. Yes. May I know how old are you? I am 39. 39. Perfect. Are you a salary or self-employed here? I am a salary. Salary. May I know how much is the salary? 46. Perfect. How long have you been working with this company? I have been a government company and I have been here since 11 years. That is very nice. Any liabilities you have taken? No. Personal loan, credit card, nothing? No, I don't have any. So this is your big mortgage? Yes. Not the first loan but I don't have currency in any loans. Okay. You have done all the outings. Yes, of course. Perfect. May I know which passport you hold? Pakistan. Okay. So the property which you are planning, it is ready to move in, right? Yes. Perfect. And the price is 1 million or it can fluctuate? See, it can fluctuate between 1 to 1.1. Okay. I will put it as that. Perfect. And this is going to be the first property or you have properties? This will be the first property. First property. Perfect. So I will put it as looking for the pre-approval. Once the pre-approval will be with you, you have 45 days to avail that. Okay. Within that period of time, you have to get the property done and start the mortgage. Otherwise, if you cross the 45 days, then you have to again go for the pre-approval and the same process. Okay. Okay. All right. My mortgage advisor will give you a call in short time. You have a word with them regarding this. Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Have a lovely day. Thank you.\",\n",

       "  'content': {'text': \" Yes, hello? Yes, hi. This is Naila once again. Is it clear now? Is it better? Yes, it's much better. Yes. Perfect. Hi. So I'm calling you with reference to mortgage assistance. You've mentioned you're a Canadian national who wants to buy out his existing loan from EDIB. Yes, correct. So it's basically a proper team's print. The value right now is around 3 million. The mortgage remaining is around 1.5. And the most important part is I do not have a salary in Dubai. I work international. So this is the most important for you to decide. And I have made a deal with the bank last, I think it's already a year that I'm having a 6.2.89 interest for three years. I need to check the books just to make sure. But it's like, roughly, this is the situation. The pointy. Yes, for three years. And remaining is 1.5. I took it in 2012 for 25 years. That means I still have minus 12. I still have 12 or 13 years. Okay. Okay. So this is the situation. Just wondering if there is a better deal that I could get. And this is from which bank? Is it from a UAE bank or? ID? IDIP. Perfect. So see, we can go ahead and check the eligibility for you. But you told me you're working outside UAE. So how much is your monthly salary outside UAE and which country are you working in? Let me do some calculation. Anyways, I don't want any mortgage to be related to the employment salary. It's just simply on the rental of the property. Is that possible? See, the thing is that we need the customer's basic details as well in order for us to check the eligibility if the client is eligible. So we will consider your profile as a non-resident. So you're a resident in UAE, but you are working outside UAE. So we have to go through the process of a non-resident client, not the resident one. Yeah. So it's like all the other banks. It's the same situation I understand. So let's say just trust me, I will do some calculation. Let's see 100. Define by, this is in US, total is 360. Define by 12. So it's around 30,000 dirhams per month. 30,000 dirhams per month. Okay. And can I have your nationality as well? It's in Canada. It's Canadian. So the employment is in Canada. Sure. What's your age? 47. And are you holding any liabilities in UAE? No. Any credit cards, personal loans, auto loans, nothing at all, right? I have credit cards, but they're all like zero, one. Okay. But do you remember the total limit of the card you're holding? Let's see. I have many. So I have 18. Okay. Roughly. Yeah. I'm doing the math here. Okay. 15. 15, 18, 18. I think there is another. Let's say 60,000. Approximately 60,000. Yeah, that's maximum 60,000. Okay. All right. Just one moment. All right. And the property we are referring to, it's ready to move in, you know, project, right? It's already completed. It's a completed project. Okay. And the amount you told me was just spending to be paid. How much? 1.5 million, approximately. In the rooms. Okay. Yeah. And this is your first property in UAE, or do you already have another mortgage going on? No, that's the only one. That's the only one. All right. So, Mr. Mohammed, I got your details here and I would like to know if you're working with this company for how long? How many years now? Since 2016. Around seven years. Seven years? Yeah. Yeah. And you're based in UAE since how long? You're a resident here in UAE? My residency is since 2017. Now, the thing is, I have a residency since 2009. I just disconnected between 2013 and 2017. I canceled my residency, but yeah, the first time I became resident, 2009. Okay. The first time you came here in 2009 and then went back and came back in 2017. So, yeah, for four years I was away. Then I came back with residency. Employment is still in Canada, but I have residency and I was hired here. Since 2017, you did disconnect your visa, just you're keeping it renewal every time. Correct. Perfect. Okay. So, yeah, I got your details, Mohammed. I'll forward it to one of my mortgage experts and they will evaluate and get the best deal for you. I think so far I feel that you are eligible according to your profile, but still they have a bureau check thing. I'm not sure if you're aware about, as per UAE law, we have to do a if they have bureau check for all the customers. So, we will be processing that and running that for you. And one of my experts will be getting in touch with you in next 48 to maximum three days, 72 hours. Okay. Sounds good. Yeah. Thank you, Mohammed. Have a great weekend. Bye-bye. Thank you. Take care. Bye.\",\n",
